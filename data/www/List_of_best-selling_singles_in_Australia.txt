This is a list of best-selling singles in Australia that have been certified by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). From 1983, ARIA certifies a single Platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies across Australia. All singles in this list must have won at least quadruple ARIA Platinum Awards (280,000 copies). Prior to 1989, the values of the certifications were different, and a dearth of published data has made it difficult to source earlier release numbers.
