Thelonious Monk Trio is an album by American jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk. It was originally released in 1954 as Monk's first proper studio album and has been re-released numerous times, occasionally under the title Monk's Moods and with different track orders.
The album features his earliest recordings for the Prestige label performed with Gary Mapp [originally listed as "Gerry Mapp"] and Art Blakey or Max Roach, and one track with Percy Heath replacing Mapp. The album contains the earliest recorded versions of the jazz standards "Blue Monk" and "Bemsha Swing".
