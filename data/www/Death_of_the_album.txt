Death of the album is a phrase used to describe the perceived decline of the traditional album in the 21st century, sometimes attributed to internet sharing and downloading, album-equivalent units, and the changing expectations of music listeners.
Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.
As opposed to releasing an album, some bands have begun releasing a series of singles or EPs as a way to combat the "average person's short attention span."
