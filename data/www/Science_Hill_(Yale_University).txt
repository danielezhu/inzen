Science Hill is a precinct of the Yale University campus primarily devoted to physical and biological sciences. It is located in the Prospect Hill neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut.
Originally a 36-acre residential estate known as Sachem's Wood, it was purchased by the university in 1910 and has been allocated to large scientific laboratories and the main buildings of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.
