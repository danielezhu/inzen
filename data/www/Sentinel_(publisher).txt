Sentinel was established in 2003 as a dedicated conservative imprint within Penguin Group (USA). It publishes a wide variety of right-of-center books on subjects like politics, history, public policy, culture, religion and international relations. Its most notable books include Donald Rumsfeld’s memoir, Known and Unknown, Mike Huckabee’s Do the Right Thing, A Simple Christmas, and A Simple Government, and A Patriot’s History of the United States by Larry Schweikart.
Founder, President, and Publisher Adrian Zackheim joined Penguin Group in September 2001 to launch Portfolio, the company's business book imprint. He took on the additional role of founder and publisher of Sentinel in April 2003. He has a long track record of publishing books by notable conservatives, including Margaret Thatcher, Newt Gingrich, and Bob Dole.
