The Italian Music Awards were an accolade established in 2001 by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry to recognize the achievements in the Italian music business both by domestic and international artists.
The awards were given by an academy composed of 400 people, including music publishers, journalists, deejays, music producers, managers, retailers and consumers.
The first Italian Music Awards ceremony was held on 5 February 2001, to honor musical accomplishments for the period between 1 December 1999 and 30 November 2000, while the fourth and last awards ceremony was held on 15 December 2003. The fifth edition of the awards was initially scheduled to be held in the end of 2004, but after being postponed in February 2004 and then in the Spring of 2004, it was canceled due to the lack of a broadcast agreement with the Italian TV networks.
The gap left by the Italian Music Awards was later filled by the Wind Music Awards, established in 2007.
