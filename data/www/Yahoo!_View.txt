Yahoo! View is a video on demand service operated by Yahoo!. In partnership with Hulu, it streams recent episodes of television series from the ABC, NBC, and Fox networks in the United States, as well as a moderate selection of archived programs from various distributors.
It was initially established as Yahoo! Video, a video hosting service. Later on, the ability to upload video was removed, and the website began operating as a portal for curated video content hosted by Yahoo's properties. In 2011, the service was re-launched as Yahoo! Screen, placing a larger focus on original content and web series. Yahoo! Screen also acquired the sitcom Community for an additional season, following its cancellation after the fifth season on NBC.
As of September 2013, the service had more than 1,000 hours of content. In January 2016, following a $42 million write-down on the poor performance of its original content, Yahoo! Screen was shut down. In August 2016, Yahoo! announced a partnership with subscription video-on-demand service Hulu to move its free video library to a de facto successor known as Yahoo! View.
