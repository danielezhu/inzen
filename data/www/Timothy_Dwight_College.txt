Timothy Dwight College, commonly abbreviated and referred to as "TD", is a residential college at Yale University named after two presidents of Yale, Timothy Dwight IV and his grandson, Timothy Dwight V. The college was designed in 1935 by James Gamble Rogers in the Federal-style architecture popular during the elder Timothy Dwight's presidency and was most recently renovated in 2002. In 2015, TD won its Yale-leading 13th Tyng Cup, the championship prize for Yale's year-long intramural athletic competition among the twelve residential colleges.
