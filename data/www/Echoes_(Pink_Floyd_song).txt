"Echoes" is a composition by Pink Floyd including fully extended instrumental passages, continuous sound effects, and musical improvisation. Written in 1970 by all four members of the group, "Echoes" provides the extended finale to Pink Floyd's album Meddle. The track has a running time of 23:31 and takes up the entire second side of the vinyl and cassette recordings.
It also appears in shortened form as the fifth track on the compilation album which took its name, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. "Echoes" is the third-longest song in Pink Floyd's catalogue, after "Atom Heart Mother" (23:44) and the combined segments of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" (26:01). Unlike those pieces, it is not explicitly divided into separate parts; however, the composition was originally assembled from separate fragments and was later split in two parts to serve as both the opening and closing numbers in the band's film Live at Pompeii. It retains the title as the longest song by Pink Floyd that is not split into parts. The song was used to open the band's 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour after not being played for over a decade, but was retired again after 11 shows. The song was finally revived again for Gilmour's 2006 On an Island Tour where it was performed every night and a live version was released on Live in Gda≈Ñsk and Remember That Night.
