Calhoun College is a residential college of Yale University. It was opened in 1933 as one of the original eight undergraduate residential colleges endowed by Edward Harkness. The building was designed by John Russell Pope. The college is named after John C. Calhoun, but it is to be renamed in honor of Grace Hopper in 2017.
Calhoun, a US Vice President and 1804 graduate of Yale College, was an advocate of slaveholding and states' rights. Since the 1960s, Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership have prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. In 2016, the Yale Corporation chose to retain Calhoun as the college's namesake, but on February 11, 2017, following a report by a new Committee to Establish Principles on Renaming, Yale president Peter Salovey announced that this decision was reversed, and the name of the college would be changed to honor Grace Hopper, also a Yale graduate.
