China Blue High-Definition (CBHD; Chinese: 中国蓝光高清光盘; alternatively "China High Definition DVD") is a high definition optical disc format announced in September 2007 by the Optical Memory National Engineering Research Center (OMNERC) of Tsinghua University in China.
The format is a derivative of the HD DVD, a medium created by the DVD Forum designed to succeed regular DVDs.
Although HD DVD was scrapped as a result of losing the format war to Blu-ray, CBHDs continued to be produced and marketed, though only in China.
