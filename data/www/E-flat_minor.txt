E-flat minor is a minor scale consisting of the pitches E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, and D♭. In the harmonic minor, the D♭ is raised to D♮. Its key signature consists of six flats.
Its relative major is G♭ major (or enharmonically F♯ major) and its parallel major is E♭ major. Its enharmonic equivalent is D♯ minor. Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary.
