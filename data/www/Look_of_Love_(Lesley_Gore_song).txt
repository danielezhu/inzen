"Look of Love" is a song written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, which was a 1964 Top 40 hit for Lesley Gore. The song was one in a long line of successful "Brill Building Sound" hits created by composers and arrangers working in New York City's Brill Building at 1619 Broadway. Pop songwriting stars Barry and Greenwich had previously scored hits with songs such as "Be My Baby" and "Baby, I Love You" (The Ronettes), and "Then He Kissed Me" and "Da Doo Ron Ron" (The Crystals).
The most commercially successful solo singer to be identified with the girl group sound, Lesley Gore hit the number one spot with her first release, "It's My Party," in 1963. Look of Love was produced by Quincy Jones, who amped up the teenager's sound with double-tracked vocals and intricate backup vocals and horns. "Irresistibly melodic... it remains a classic archetype of female adolescent yearning."
In the US, Look of Love peaked at #27 on the Billboard charts. The song has been covered by other artists, notably Pattie D'Arcy, Ellie Greenwich, and The Copycats.
