Melody Maker was a British weekly pop/rock/electronic music newspaper, one of the world's earliest music weeklies (according to its publisher, IPC Media, the earliest). It was founded in 1926, largely as a magazine for dance band musicians, by Leicester-born composer, publisher Lawrence Wright; the first editor was Edgar Jackson. In 2000 it was merged into "long-standing rival" (and IPC Media sister publication) New Musical Express.
