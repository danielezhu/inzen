Paramount Pictures Corporation (known professionally as Paramount Pictures and often referred to simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994. Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world, the second oldest in the United States, and the sole member of the "Big Six" film studios still located in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood. In 1916, Zukor contracted 22 actors and actresses and honored each with a star on the logo. These fortunate few would become the first "movie stars." Paramount Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).
In 2014, Paramount Pictures became the first major Hollywood studio to distribute all of its films in digital form only.
