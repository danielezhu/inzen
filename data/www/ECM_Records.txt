ECM (Edition of Contemporary Music) is an independent record label founded by Manfred Eicher in Munich in 1969. While ECM is best known for jazz music, the label has released a variety of recordings, and ECM's artists often refuse to acknowledge boundaries between genres. ECM's motto is "the Most Beautiful Sound Next to Silence", according to a 1971 review of ECM releases in CODA, a Canadian jazz magazine.
ECM has been distributed in the U.S. by Warner Bros. Records, PolyGram Records, BMG, and, since 1999, Universal Music, the successor of PolyGram.
Its album covers have been profiled in two books: Sleeves of Desire and Windfall Light, both published by Lars MÃ¼ller.
