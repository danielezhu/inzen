An audio engineer (also sometimes recording engineer or a vocal engineer) works on the recording, manipulating the record using equalization and electronic effects, mixing, reproduction, and reinforcement of sound. Audio engineers work on the "...technical aspect of recordingâ€”the placing of microphones, pre-amp knobs, the setting of levels. The physical recording of any project is done by an engineer ... the nuts and bolts." Many audio engineers creatively use technologies to produce sound for film, radio, television, music, and video games. Audio engineers also set up, sound check and do live sound mixing using an audio console and a sound reinforcement system for music concerts, theatre, sports games and corporate events.
Alternatively, the term "audio engineer" can refer to a scientist or professional engineer who holds a B.Sc. or M.Sc. who designs, develops and builds new audio technologies working within the field of acoustical engineering.
Audio engineering concerns the creative and practical aspects of sounds including speech and music, as well as the development of new audio technologies and advancing scientific understanding of audible sound.
