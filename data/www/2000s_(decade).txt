The 2000s was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.
The growth of the Internet contributed to globalization during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world.
The economic growth of the 2000s had considerable social, environmental and mass extinction consequences, raised demand for diminishing energy resources, and was still vulnerable, as demonstrated by the financial crisis of 2007â€“08.
