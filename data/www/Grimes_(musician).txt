Claire Elise Boucher (born March 17, 1988), better known by the stage name Grimes, is a Canadian record producer, songwriter, music engineer, singer, video director and editor, and visual artist.
Boucher released the studio albums Geidi Primes and Halfaxa in 2010, and signed a recording contract with 4AD in 2011. Her third studio album Visions (2012) and its singles "Genesis" and "Oblivion" received widespread critical acclaim; it was hailed as "one of the most impressive albums of the year so far" by The New York Times, was nominated for the Polaris Prize, and received the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. Her fourth studio album Art Angels was released in 2015 and like Visions, it received widespread critical acclaim. Art Angels was nominated for the Alternative Album of the Year and the Recording Package of the Year at Juno Awards 2017.
Grimes' music has been noted by critics and journalists for its atypical combination of vocal elements, as well as an array of influences across electronic and pop, hip hop and R&B, experimental and medieval music.
