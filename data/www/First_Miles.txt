First Miles is a compilation album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released in July 12, 1990 by Savoy Records. The album includes tracks from Davis's first recording session, backing singer Rubberlegs Williams on April 24, 1945, and the first session produced under his name, leading the members of Charlie Parker's band on August 14, 1947.
Davis plays no solos in the session with Rubberlegs Williams, only being heard as part of an ensemble. He says in his autobiography he was so nervous on his first ever recording he could hardly play, and he forgot most of the details as he put the experience out of his mind.
Davis had already recorded several sessions by 1947 as a member of Parker's band for the Savoy and Dial labels, but whereas Parker usually recorded with no rehearsals, Davis had the group rehearse the material twice before recording. Davis wrote and arranged all four tracks, which were released as 78rpm singles under the name "Miles Davis All-Stars". The four tracks have also been compiled on numerous Charlie Parker Savoy compilations, including Bird: The Savoy Recordings (Master Takes) (SJL 2201). Davis' next recording session as leader would be the first of the Birth of the Cool sessions in 1949, after having left Parker's band.
