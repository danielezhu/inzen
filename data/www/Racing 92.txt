Racing 92 (French pronunciation: ​[ʁasiŋ ka.tʁə.vɛ̃.duz]) is a French rugby union club based in suburban Paris that was formed in 2001 with the collaboration of the Racing Club de France and US Métro. They were called Racing Métro 92 between 2001 and 2015, when they changed the name to Racing 92. "92" is the number of Hauts-de-Seine, a département of Île-de-France, bordering Paris to the west, where they play, and whose council gives financial backing to the club. They currently play in the Top 14, having been promoted as 2008–09 champions of Rugby Pro D2. Racing 92 play at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir stadium at Colombes, where the France national team played for several decades.
