Latin jazz is a genre of jazz with Latin American rhythms. Although musicians continually expand its parameters, the term Latin jazz is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. Some Latin jazz typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa, or exhibit an African influence. The two main categories of Latin jazz are:
Afro-Cuban jazz—jazz rhythmically based on Cuban popular dance music, often with a rhythm section employing ostinato patterns and/or a clave.
Afro-Brazilian jazz—includes bossa nova and jazz samba.
This is becoming popular among with Jazz fusion.
