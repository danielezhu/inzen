The Center for the Book was founded in 1977 by Daniel J. Boorstin, the Librarian of Congress, in order to use the Library of Congress to promote literacy, libraries, and reading in general, as well as an understanding of the history and heritage of American literature. The Center for the Book is mainly supported by tax-deductible donations. In 1984 the Center began creating affiliated State Centers for the Book. Today the Center for the Book has an affiliate Center in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
