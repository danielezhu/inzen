It features a large selection of blues and roots performers, from Australia and around the world, and is one of the world's leading contemporary music festivals.
It was founded by Keven Oxford in 1990 and is now run by Peter Noble who joined Oxford for the 1994 event. It has been held at several locations in and around Byron Bay, and is currently held at Tyagarah, 11 kilometres drive north of Byron Bay town. Originally running for three days, it now runs for five days, from Thursday to Monday. From an original crowd of 6,000, it now attracts annual audiences of over 101,000 across the five days. Patrons range from locals to international visitors, from a wide age range.
