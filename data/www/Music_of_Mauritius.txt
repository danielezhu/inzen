Musicians in Mauritius are very talented and through the years Mauritian Music has evolved to international standards. There are many jazz and Blues Artists around the Island.
Sega, Seggae and Reggae remain the most popular produced Music in Mauritius amongst Mauritian artists. Thanks to a decent Internet connection nowadays we see more evolved artists doing RnB, Hip-Hop, Soul, Dubstep, Club, Techno and other worldwide known music.
The Sega is usually sung in Creole (mother tongue of Mauritians). Many singers had thought of also bringing forward the English version of the Sega songs but later resolved not to proceed with it so as to preserve the uniqueness and cultural richness of the local music of Mauritius.
The original instruments are fast disappearing, making way for the more conventional orchestra ensemble. However, all along the coastal fishing villages, the traditional instruments such as the “Ravanne”, “Triangle”, the “Maravanne” and the traditional guitar are still being used.
