The question of the internal consistency of the Bible concerns the coherence and textual integrity of the biblical scriptures. Disputes regarding biblical consistency have a long history.
Classic texts that discuss questions of inconsistency, from a critical secular perspective, include The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine, the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus by Baruch Spinoza, the Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot, and the Dictionnaire philosophique of Voltaire.
