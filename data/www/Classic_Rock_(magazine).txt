Classic Rock is a British magazine dedicated to rock music, published by Future PLC, who are also responsible for its "sister" publications Metal Hammer and Prog magazine. Although firmly focusing on key bands from the 1960s through early 1990s, it also includes articles and reviews of contemporary and upcoming artists it deems worthy of note. Despite starting as an on-off project it became one of the UK's best selling music magazines. In September 2010 it published its 150th issue and now has a higher circulation than the NME.
Former owner TeamRock bought Metal Hammer, Prog and Classic Rock from Future PLC in 2013. On 19 December 2016, TeamRock called in the administrators with the loss of 73 jobs, after experiencing financial difficulties, and suspended publication of all three titles. On 8 January 2017, Classic Rock, along with sister magazines Metal Hammer and Prog, were bought by previous owners Future Publishing for Â£800,000, and resumed publishing.
