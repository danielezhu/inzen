This following is a list of U.S. institutions of higher education with endowments greater than one billion dollars according to National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO).
Since colleges and universities vary greatly in terms of the size of their student bodies, a table with endowment per student figures is included as well. For example, Yale University's endowment is smaller than Harvard University's, yet Yale University's endowment per student figure is larger than Harvard University's.
The endowment table below totals $219.37 Billion in 2005. At the end of 2015 the table below totals $394.96 Billion, an increase of 80% in billion dollar university endowments.
