Polyvore is a community-powered social commerce website headquartered in Silicon Valley, California. The company's virtual mood board function allows community members to add products into a shared product index, and use them to create image collages called "Sets". They can also browse other users' sets for inspiration, share sets with friends and interact with people through comments and likes. Due to the visual nature of the tool Polyvore is mostly used to build sets in the fields of home decoration, beauty and fashion. Online retailers, too, can upload their product images to Polyvore and link back to their product pages or use Polyvore to encourage users to showcase their products through such activities as board creation competitions. Polyvore opened an office in New York City in August 2012. At that point the company said it had amassed 17 million active users. By the end of 2012 the company said its site was receiving 20 million unique visitors per month, a number which continues to be used in 2016.
Polyvore was initially funded in three rounds by six investors, including initial investors Benchmark Capital and Harrison Metal, and Matrix Partners and DAG Ventures as lead investors in later rounds. It was acquired by Yahoo on July 31, 2015.
