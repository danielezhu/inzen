In western music, China-type cymbals are a distinct type of crash cymbals designed to produce a bright, crisp, and explosive tone. It is for this reason that they have been nicknamed "trash cymbals". The name "China cymbal" is derived from its similarity in sound and shape to Chinese gongs. They are most frequently mounted upside down on cymbal stands, allowing for them to be more easily struck and for a better sound.
China-type cymbals are mostly commonplace in various interpretations of rock music, particularly heavy metal and thrash metal. It is also frequently used for jazz fusion and Latin, especially those with elaborate drum solos. In Latin and several world music, China cymbals are usually played in conjunction with other percussions instead of a drum kit, such as timbales, octobans or surdo.
