Anugerah Juara Lagu (AJL, Malay for "Champion of Songs Awards") is a popular annual music competition in Malaysia, organised by TV3 since 1986. It features the best musical and lyrical compositions of each year it is held. Nominees are derived from a list of mostly Malay songs which have garnered the most public votes in Muzik Muzik throughout the year, and then progress into the semifinals, from which twelve songs will be nominated by a panel of judges to become the winner of Juara Lagu.
AJL honours the composers and lyricists of the songs rather than the performing artistes.
In the 27th edition, a song which was not sung by an original singer won Juara Lagu for the first time.
