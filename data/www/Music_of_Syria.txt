The music of Syria largely emanates from the country's capital Damascus and the largest city Aleppo. Syria has long been one of the Arab world's centers for cultural and artistic innovation, especially in the field of classical Arab music. Syria has also produced several pan-Arab stars, including George Wassouf and Nour Mahana. The city of Aleppo is known for its muwashshah, a form of Andalous sung poetry popularized by Sabri Moudallal. Dabka and other forms of dance music are also popular and native to the greater region.
