"Colors of the Wind" is a song written by lyricist Stephen Schwartz and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures' 33rd animated feature film Pocahontas (1995). The film's theme song, "Colors of the Wind" was originally recorded by American singer and actress Judy Kuhn in her role as the singing voice of Pocahontas. Vanessa Williams's cover of the song was released as the lead single from the film's soundtrack on March 23, 1995. A pop ballad, produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Keith Thomas, the song's lyrics speak of respecting nature and living in harmony with the Earth's creatures. The song is also featured on her third studio album The Sweetest Days.
"Colors of the Wind" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 68th Academy Awards in 1995, becoming composer Alan Menken's fourth win in the category. It also won the Golden Globe in the same category as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Movie. The song poetically presents the Native American viewpoint that the earth is a living entity where humankind is connected to everything in nature.
Months before Pocahontas was released, the film version of Colors of the Wind was featured on the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection VHS release for Walt Disney Pictures' 32nd animated feature film The Lion King (1994).
