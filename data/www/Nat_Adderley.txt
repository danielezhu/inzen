Nathaniel "Nat" Adderley (November 25, 1931 â€“ January 2, 2000) was an American jazz cornet and trumpet player who played in the hard bop and soul jazz genres. He was the brother of saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley, whom he remained very close to in his career but under whose shadow he lived for most of his life.
Nat Adderly's "Work Song" is a jazz standard which also became a success on the pop charts after singer Oscar Brown, Jr. wrote lyrics for the tune.
