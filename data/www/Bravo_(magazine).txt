Bravo is the largest teen magazine within the German-language sphere. The first issue was published in 1956, subtitled as "the magazine for film and television" („Die Zeitschrift für Film und Fernsehen“). Marilyn Monroe's portrait graced the first published issue, the never-published dummy issue cover displayed Elvis Presley.
