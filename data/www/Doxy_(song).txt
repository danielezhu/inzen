"Doxy" is an early composition by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. It first appeared on the 1957 Miles Davis album Bags' Groove, performed by Davis on trumpet, Rollins on tenor saxophone, Horace Silver on piano, Percy Heath on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums. When Rollins eventually established his own record label, he named it Doxy Records. The chords are from Bob Carleton's 16-bar song, "Ja-Da".
"Doxy" has become a jazz standard, a frequently performed and recorded part of many musicians' repertoires. "Doxy" was written by Sonny Rollins during his stopover in England on a European tour. Its name is given after a bread-spread that the band was eating in the hotel.
