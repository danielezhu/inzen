Channel V Australia, stylized as Channel [V], was an Australian subscription television music channel that was available on Foxtel, Optus TV and Austar satellite and cable services. It was also previously available in New Zealand on TelstraSaturn's cable TV service in Wellington, Kapiti and Christchurch, until a channel shake-up occurred under new owners TelstraClear in 2002.
Channel [V] was targeted at the youth market, and played both mainstream and alternative music from local and international artists. Although it used the name Channel [V] in Australia, it was not associated with the international affiliates and used the name under the license of News Corporation via STAR TV. However, the Australian version of Channel V was previously operated by STAR TV and XYZ Entertainment (xyznetworks).
Previously called Red, Channel [V] commenced broadcasting in April 1995 on the now defunct Galaxy service. The name change to Channel [V] came about after owners XYZ Entertainment (now xyznetworks) and Channel [V] International came to agreement over naming rights in March 1997. The first Channel Manager of Channel [V] was ex Network TEN Video Hits Producer Donna Andrews. After the successful launch, ex radio man Barry Chapman took over. In 2004, the launch of Foxtel Digital and other digital cable and satellite services, saw a second [V] branded channel begin broadcasting called V Hits (formerly Club[V]), which is a 24-hour music channel that focuses more on music without TV shows.
Channel [V] closed on 25 March 2016, replaced with a two hour timeshift channel of [V] Hits. Starting from 27 February 2016, [V] saw programming changes, which included the end of all programs which involved VJs and other personnel. This was followed by the relaunch of [V] Hits as the main music clip channel, featuring only music videos and countdowns. The closure came as viewers increasingly sought music videos from online sources rather than on television, which had resulted in a steady decline in [V]'s viewership. As a result of the closure, three staff members were made redundant, and Danny Clayton's contract with the network (which was set to expire midyear) was not renewed.
