A brass band is a musical ensemble generally consisting entirely of brass instruments, most often with a percussion section. Ensembles that include brass and woodwind instruments can in certain traditions also be termed brass bands (particularly in the context of New Orleansâ€“style brass bands), but may more correctly termed military bands, concert bands, or "brass and reed" bands.
