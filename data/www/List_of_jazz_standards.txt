This is an Aâ€“Z list of jazz standards. It is intended to be as comprehensive a list as possible, including those pop standards and film song classics which have been sung or performed in jazz on numerous occasions and are considered part of the jazz repertoire. For a chronological list of jazz standards with author details, see the lists in the box on the right. Entries in italics are alternative titles for songs that appear elsewhere on the list.
