**Cornell University** (/ kɔːrˈnɛl/ _kor- **NEL**_) is a private and statutory
Ivy League research university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by
Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White,[7] the university was intended to teach
and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from the classics to the
sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals,
unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865
Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can
find instruction in any study."[1]

The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and
seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and
division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near
autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one
in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar, and Cornell Tech, a
graduate program that incorporates technology, business, and creative
thinking. The program moved from Google's Chelsea Building in New York City to
its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017.

Cornell is one of three private land grant universities in the United States
and the only one in New York.[note 1] Of its seven undergraduate colleges,
three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State
University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and human
ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school. Of
Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As
a land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach
program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State
of New York for certain educational missions.[8] The Cornell University Ithaca
Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic
Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) and the numerous university-owned lands in New
York City are considered.[9]

Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian
institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race.
Cornell counts more than 245,000 living alumni, and its former and present
faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars, 29 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman
Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 46 Nobel laureates and 14 living
billionaires.[10][11][12] The student body consists of more than 14,000
undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and more
than 120 countries.[13][14]

## History[edit]

Main article: History of Cornell University

Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS)
Senate authorized the university as the state's land grant institution.
Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a site and
$500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment. Fellow senator and
experienced educator Andrew Dickson White agreed to be the first president.
During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two
buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.[15] The university was
inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[16]

Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its
research to its own campus and to outreach efforts. For example, in 1883 it
was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-
powered dynamo to light the grounds.[17] Since 1894, Cornell has included
colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;[18] it has
also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly
funded by state and federal matching programs.[19]

Cornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes. It was one of the
first universities to include alumni-elected representatives on its Board of
Trustees.[note 2] Cornell was also among the Ivies that had heightened student
activism during the 1960s related to cultural issues, civil rights, and
opposition to the Vietnam War; with protests and occupations resulting in the
resignation of Cornell's president and the restructuring of university
governance.[20] Today the university has more than 4,000 courses.[21]

Since 2000, Cornell has been expanding its international programs. In 2004,
the university opened the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[22] It has
partnerships with institutions in India, Singapore, and the People's Republic
of China.[23][24][25] Former president Jeffrey S. Lehman described the
university, with its high international profile, a "transnational
university".[26] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid the
cornerstone for a new 'Bridging the Rift Center' to be built and jointly
operated for education on the Israel–Jordan border.[27]

### Ithaca campus[edit]

Main articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West
Campus

Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking the
town and Cayuga Lake. Since the university was founded, it has expanded to
about 2,300 acres (9.3 km2), encompassing both the hill and much of the
surrounding areas.[28] Central Campus has laboratories, administrative
buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic
facilities, auditoriums, and museums. Collegetown contains two upper-class
residence halls[29][30] and the Schwartz Performing Arts Center amid a mixed-
use neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[31]

The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic architectural
styles, including ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical
buildings, and the more spare international and modernist structures. The more
ornate buildings generally predate World War II. The student population
doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural
styles favored modernism.[32] While some buildings are neatly arranged into
quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities
arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the
campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, Frederick Law Olmsted, the
designer of Central Park, proposed a "grand terrace" overlooking Cayuga
Lake.[33]

Several of the university buildings are listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, including the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall,
Caldwell Hall, Comstock Hall, Morrill Hall (Cornell University), and Deke
House. At least three other historic buildings—the original Roberts Hall, East
Robert Hall and Stone Hall—have also been listed on the NRHP. The university
demolished them in the 1980s to make way for other development.[34] In
September 2011, _Travel+Leisure_ listed the Ithaca Campus as among the most
beautiful in the United States.[35]

Located among the rolling valleys of the Finger Lakes region, the campus on a
hill provides views of the surrounding area, including 38 miles (61.4 km) long
Lake Cayuga. Two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, bound Central
Campus and are used as popular swimming holes during the warmer months
(although the university and city code discourage their use).[36] Adjacent to
the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800 acre (11.6 km2) Cornell Botanic
Gardens, a botanical garden containing flowers, trees, and ponds, with
manicured trails providing access through the facility.[37]

The university has embarked on numerous 'green' initiatives. In 2009, a new
gas-fired combined heat and power facility replaced a coal-fired steam plant,
resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions to 7% below 1990 levels, and
projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75,000 tons per year.[38] This
facility satisfies 15% of campus electrical needs,[39] and a university-run,
on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall Creek Gorge provides an additional
2%.[40] The university has a lake source cooling project that uses Lake Cayuga
to air condition campus buildings, with an 80% energy saving over conventional
systems.[41] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable
Future.[42] Cornell has been rated "A-" by the 2011 College Sustainability
Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[43]

### New York City campuses[edit]

#### Weill Cornell[edit]

Main article: Weill Cornell Medicine

Weill Medical Center overlooks the East River in New York City.

Cornell's medical campus in New York, also called Weill Cornell, is on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City. It is home to two Cornell
divisions: Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of
Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated with the NewYork–Presbyterian
Hospital since 1927.[44] Although their faculty and academic divisions are
separate, the Medical Center shares its administrative and teaching hospital
functions with the Columbia University Medical Center.[45] These teaching
hospitals include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and the Westchester
Division in White Plains, New York.[46] Weill Cornell Medical College is also
affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center,
Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. Many faculty
members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill Cornell,
Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD
Program to selected entering Cornell medical students.[47] From 1942 to 1979,
the campus also housed a Cornell school of nursing.[48]

#### Cornell Tech[edit]

Main article: Cornell Tech

On December 19, 2011, Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of
Technology won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100
million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The
competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in order
to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector.
The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square feet state-of-the-art tech
campus to be built on Roosevelt Island on the site of the former Coler-
Goldwater Specialty Hospital. Instruction began in the fall of 2012 in a
temporary location in Manhattan (111 Eighth Avenue in space donated by
Google).[49] Thom Mayne of the architecture firm Morphosis has been selected
to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island. Begun in
2014, construction is expected to be completed for the fall start of the 2017
academic year.[50]

#### Other New York City programs[edit]

In addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell maintains local
offices in New York City for some of its service programs. The Cornell Urban
Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers,
arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest
children, families, and communities.[51] The NYS College of Human Ecology and
the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences enable students to reach out
to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative
Extension.[52] Students with the NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations'
Extension & Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to
organizations, union members, policymakers, and working adults.[53] The
College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's
financial district, brings together business optimization research and
decision support services addressed to both financial applications and public
health logistics planning.[54] The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning
has a 11,000 square foot Gensler-designed facility in 26 Broadway (The
Standard Oil Building) in the Financial District that opened in 2015.[55]

### Qatar campus[edit]

Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar

Main article: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar

Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education City, near Doha. Opened
in September 2004, this is the first American medical school to be established
outside the United States. The college is part of Cornell's program to
increase its international influence. The college is a joint initiative with
the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs
and medical care.[22] Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors
the curriculum taught at Weill Medical College in New York City, the college
offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical program with a separate admissions
process. This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first
coeducational institute of higher education in Qatar.[56]

The college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the Qatar
Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its construction.[57] The
medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by Arata
Isozaki, an internationally known Japanese architect.[58] In 2004, the Qatar
Foundation announced the construction of a 350-bed Specialty Teaching Hospital
near the medical college in Education City. The hospital was to be completed
in a few years.[22]

### Other facilities[edit]

Cornell University owns and/or operates other facilities.[59] The Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico, site of the world's largest single-dish radio
telescope, was operated by Cornell under a contract with the National Science
Foundation from its construction until 2011.[60] The Shoals Marine Laboratory,
operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire,[61] is a
seasonal marine field station dedicated to undergraduate education and
research on the 95-acre (0.4 km2) Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire
coast.[62]

Cornell has facilities devoted to conservation and ecology. The New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station, operated by the College of Agriculture and
Life Sciences, is in Geneva, New York, 50 miles (80 km) northwest of the main
campus. It operates three substations: The Cornell Lake Erie Research and
Extension Laboratory (CLEREL) in Portland, New York,[63] Hudson Valley
Laboratory in Highland,[64] and the Long Island Horticultural Research
Laboratory in Riverhead.[65]

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca's Sapsucker Woods performs research
on biological diversity, primarily in birds.[66] On April 18, 2005, the lab
announced that it had rediscovered the ivory-billed woodpecker, long thought
to be extinct (Some experts disputed the evidence and subsequent surveys were
inconclusive).[67] The Animal Science Teaching and Research Center in Harford,
New York, and the Duck Research Laboratory in Eastport, New York, are
resources for information on animal disease control and husbandry.[68][69]

The Cornell Biological Field Station in Bridgeport, New York, conducts long-
term ecological research and supports the university's educational programs,
with special emphasis on freshwater lake systems.[70] The Department of
Horticulture operates the Freeville Organic Research Farm and Homer C.
Thompson Vegetable Research Farm in Freeville, New York.[10] The university
operates biodiversity laboratories in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic,[71] and
one in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest (Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field
Laboratory).[72]

The university arranges study abroad and scholarship programs. The Cornell in
Washington is a program that allows students to study for a semester in
Washington, D.C., holding research or internship positions while earning
credit toward a degree.[73] Cornell in Rome, operated by the College of
Architecture, Art, and Planning, allows students to use the city as a resource
for learning architecture, urban studies, and art.[74] Similarly, the Capital
Semester program allows students to intern in the New York state legislature
in Albany.

As New York State's land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative
extension service with 56 offices spread out across the state, each staffed
with extension educators who offer programs in five subjects: Agriculture and
Food Systems; Children, Youth, and Families; Community and Economic Vitality;
Environment and Natural Resources; and Nutrition and Health.[75] Cornell also
operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center.[76]

Cornell is a non-profit organization governed by a 64-member board of trustees
consisting of both privately and publicly appointed trustees. Three trustees
are appointed by the Governor of New York: one seat is reserved for the eldest
lineal descendant of Ezra Cornell; two members from each of the fields of
agriculture, business and labor in New York state; eight trustees to be
elected from among and by the alumni of the university; two trustees to be
elected from among and by the faculty of the university at Ithaca and Geneva;
two trustees to be elected from among and by the membership of the
university's student body at Ithaca (one undergraduate and one graduate
student);[77] and one trustee to be elected from among and by the nonacademic
staff and employees of the university at Ithaca and Geneva, 37 trustees at
large and finally, the Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, Speaker of
the Assembly, and president of the university serve in an _ex officio_ voting
capacity.[78][79] Robert Harrison has served as the chairman of the board
since 2014.[80] The board elects a President to serve as the chief executive
and educational officer.[78]

Martha E. Pollack was inaugurated as Cornell's fourteenth president on August
25, 2017.[81][82] She succeeded Elizabeth Garrett, who served from July 2015
until her death from colon cancer on March 6, 2016 — the first Cornell
president to die while in office.[83][84]

The Board of Trustees hold four regular meetings each year, and portions of
those meetings are subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.[85]

Cornell consists of nine privately endowed and four publicly supported
"statutory colleges": the New York State College of Agriculture and Life
Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations,
and College of Veterinary Medicine. These statutory colleges received $131.9
million in SUNY appropriations in 2010-2011 to support their teaching,
research, and service missions, which makes them accountable to SUNY trustees
and other state agencies. The budget also includes $3.9 million of state funds
for Cornell Cooperative Extension.[86][87][88] Residents of New York enrolled
in these colleges also qualify for discounted tuition.[89] However, Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer issued a 2005 opinion asserting that, with respect to
their academic activities, statutory colleges should be understood to be
private, non-state parties.[8]:1

Cornell is decentralized, with its colleges and schools exercising wide
autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own admissions
and advising programs, and confers its own degrees. The only university-wide
requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two
physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement.[90] A handful
of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one
college.[91][92] All academic departments are affiliated with at least one
college; the last department without such an affiliation, the Cornell Africana
Studies and Research Center, merged with the Arts College in July 2011.[93]

Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional seven provide
graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing graduate degrees in
departments of these schools are enrolled in the Graduate School. The School
of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions offers programs for college and
high school students, professionals, and other adults.[94] Of the 13,515
undergraduate students, 4,251 (31.5%) are affiliated with the largest college
by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,153 (23.3%) in Agriculture and
Life Sciences and 2,680 (19.8%) in Engineering. By student enrollment, the
smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and
Planning, with 515 (3.8%) students.[10]

Several other universities have used Cornell as their model, including
Stanford University, the University of Sydney in Australia, and the University
of Birmingham in the United Kingdom; the latter on the recommendation of one
of its financiers, Andrew Carnegie, who was a Cornell Trustee.[95]

The university also operates eCornell, which offers both certificate programs
and professional development courses online.[96] In addition to being New
York's land-grant college, Cornell is also a partner in New York's sea-grant
program,[97] is the hub of the Northeast's sun-grant program,[98] and is a
part of New York's space-grant consortium.[99]

In 2015, Cornell ranked fifth among universities in the U.S. in fund-raising,
collecting $591 million in private support.[100] In addition to the central
University development staff located in Ithaca and New York City, each college
and program has its own staffed fundraising program. In 2006, Cornell launched
a $4 billion fundraising campaign, which reached $3 billion in November
2010.[101] In 2013, Cornell's "Cornell Now" fundraising campaign raised over
$475 million.[102]

## Academics[edit]

Sage Hall, home to the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management

Cornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority
of enrollments in undergraduate programs.[103] The university has been
accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since
1921.[104] Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term
beginning in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter
session in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending
in early May.[105]

Cornell and Oregon State University are the only two institutions which are
members of the Land Grant, Sea Grant, Space Grant, and Sun Grant programs.

### Admissions[edit]

Admission to the university is highly competitive. For Fall 2017, Cornell
received 47,038 freshmen applications; 5,889 were admitted, a 12.5% acceptance
rate.[106] For the Fall 2016 enrolled freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT
scores were 650-750 for critical reading, and 680-780 for math.[107] The
middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 31-34.[107]

Cornell enrolls students from all 50 U.S. states and more than 120 countries.
As of Fall 2014, 25.7% of undergraduate students identified themselves as
members of ethnic minority groups.[10] Legacy applicants receive a slight
advantage in the admission process.[108]

In 2013, the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management accepted 21%
of its applicants for its two-year MBA program.[109]

### Financial aid[edit]

The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of Jennie McGraw, Cornell benefactress

Section 9 of the original charter of Cornell University ensured that the
university "shall be open to applicants for admission ... at the lowest rates
of expense consistent with its welfare and efficiency, and without distinction
as to rank, class, previous occupation or locality."[110] The University
Charter provided for free instruction to one student chosen from each Assembly
district in the state.[110]

Starting in the 1950s Cornell coordinated with other Ivy League schools to
provide a consistent set of financial aid. However, in 1989, a consent decree
to end a Justice Department antitrust investigation ended such
coordination.[111] Even after the decree, all Ivy League schools continue to
award aid on financial need without offering any athletic scholarships.[112]
In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy of matching any grant component
of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke University or
Stanford, if an accepted applicant is trying to decide between Cornell and
those other schools.[113]

On January 31, 2008, Cornell announced a new financial aid initiative to be
phased in over the following two years. In the first year, 2008–09, Cornell
replaced need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from
families with incomes under $60,000 and capped such loans annually at $3,000
for students from families with incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. The
following year, 2009–10, the program improved by replacing loan with
scholarships for students from families with incomes up to $75,000, and capped
annual loans at $3,000 for students from families with income between $75,000
and $120,000. For families above $120,000, need-based loans were capped at
$7,500 per year.[114] The initiative costs an additional $14 million per year
to fully implement.[115] Although Cornell's endowment dropped 27% in the
second half of 2008, its President announced that the financial aid initiative
will continue by withdrawing an additional $35 million from the endowment for
undergraduate financial aid in 2009-10.[116] Cornell is seeking $125 million
in gifts to support the financial aid initiative.[117] In 2010, 1,647 of the
3,181 full-time freshmen enrolled were found to have financial need
(40%).[118] Of these, Cornell could meet the full financial aid needs of all
1,647 freshmen. Cornell's average undergraduate student's indebtedness at
graduation is $21,549.[118]

### International programs[edit]

Cornell offers undergraduate curricula with international focuses, including
the Africana Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Jewish Studies, Latino
Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Romance Studies, and Russian Literature
majors.[10] In addition to traditional academic programs, Cornell students may
study abroad on any of six continents.[119]

The Asian Studies major, South Asia Program, South East Asia Program and China
and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS) major provide opportunities for students and
researchers in Asia. Cornell has an agreement with Peking University allowing
students in the CAPS major to spend a semester in Beijing.[120] Similarly, the
College of Engineering has an agreement to exchange faculty and graduate
students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the School of Hotel
Administration has a joint master's program with Nanyang Technological
University in Singapore. The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has
signed an agreement with Japan's National Institute of Agrobiological
Sciences,[121] and with the University of the Philippines, Los Baños,[122] to
engage in joint research and exchange graduate students and faculty members.
It also cooperates in agricultural research with the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research.[123] Cornell also offers a course on International
consulting in association with Indian Institute of Management Bangalore[124]

In the Middle East, Cornell's efforts focus on biology and medicine. The Weill
Cornell Medical College in Qatar trains new doctors to improve health services
in the region.[125] The university is also developing the Bridging the Rift
Center, a "Library of Life" (or database of all living systems) on the border
of Israel and Jordan, in collaboration with those two countries and Stanford
University.[126] Cornell has partnered with Queen's University in Canada to
offer a joint Executive MBA. The innovative program includes both on-campus
and videoconferencing-based, interactive virtual classroom sessions. Graduates
of the program earn both a Cornell MBA and a Queen's MBA.[127]

Cornell University is member of the United Nations Academic Impact aligning
institutions of higher education to the United Nations and promoting
international cooperation.

In 2015, Cornell ranked 8th domestically and 10th internationally in the CWUR
rankings.[136] Cornell ranked 14th in the 2018 edition of the QS World
University Rankings and 19th in the 2017 edition of the Times Higher Education
World University Rankings.[137][138] The university ranked 10th in the 2013
_Business Insider_ Best Colleges in America ranking,[139] 15th in the 2016
_U.S. News& World Report_ National Universities ranking,[140] and 13th
globally in an academic ranking of world universities by Academic Ranking of
World Universities in 2015, and 7th in the United States by the QS World
University Rankings in 2018.[141] Cornell was ranked 27th nationally in _The
Washington Monthly_ 's 2016 ranking of universities' contributions to
research, community service, and social mobility.[142] In 2017, the university
was ranked 7th in _The Princeton Review'_ s "Top 50 Green Colleges".[143]

In its annual edition of "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools", the
journal _Design Intelligence_ has consistently ranked Cornell's Bachelor of
Architecture program as number one in the nation (2000–2002, 2005–2007,
2009–2013 and 2015-2016). In the 2011 survey, the program ranked first and the
Master of Architecture program ranked sixth.[144] In 2011 and 2012, Design
Intelligence ranked Cornell's Master of Landscape Architecture program 4th in
the nation with the undergraduate program placing 8th for the same two
years.[145][146] Among business schools in the United States, the Johnson
School of Management at Cornell was named the No. 10 business school by
_Forbes_ in 2015,[147] 8th by _The Washington Post_ for salary potential, 14th
overall by Poets and Quants[148] but ranked 4th for Investment Banking[149]
and 6th for salary,[150] 16th by _Bloomberg Businessweek_ in 2015,[151] and
15th by The Economist in 2015.[151] The Johnson school was ranked No. 2 by
_Bloomberg Businessweek_.[152]

Cornell's international relations offerings are also ranked in _Foreign
Policy_ magazine's Inside the Ivory Tower survey, which lists the world's top
twenty of such programs at the undergraduate, Master's and Ph.D. levels.[153]
In 2012, the survey ranked Cornell 11th overall for doctoral programs and 12th
overall in the undergraduate category.[154] In 2015, Cornell University was
ranked 3rd in New York State by average professor salaries.[155]

###  Library[edit]

The Cornell Law Library is one of 12 national depositories for print records
of briefs filed with the U.S. Supreme Court.

Main article: Cornell University Library

The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest academic library in the
United States, ranked by number of volumes held.[156] Organized into 20
divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2
million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion
pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in
addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives.[157] It
was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates
to borrow books from its libraries.[10] In 2006, _The Princeton Review_ ranked
it as the 11th best college library,[158] and it climbed to 6th best in
2009.[159] The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of
scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los
Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded
by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way
many physicists and mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable
and popular means of announcing new research.[160]

###  Press and scholarly publications[edit]

Main article: Cornell University Press

The Cornell University Press, established in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to
1930, was the first university publishing enterprise in the United
States.[161][162] Today, the press is one of the country's largest university
presses.[10] It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in
various disciplines including anthropology, Asian studies, biological
sciences, classics, history, industrial relations, literary criticism and
theory, natural history, politics and international relations, veterinary
science, and women's studies.[162][163]

Cornell's academic units and student groups also publish a number of scholarly
journals. Faculty-led publications include the Johnson School's
_Administrative Science Quarterly_ ,[164] the ILR School's _Industrial and
Labor Relations Review_ , the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's _The
Philosophical Review_ , the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's
_Journal of Architecture_ , and the Law School's _Journal of Empirical Legal
Studies_.[165] Student-led scholarly publications include the _Law Review_ ,
the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs' _Cornell Policy Review_ , the
_International Law Journal_ , the _Journal of Law and Public Policy_ , the
_International Affairs Review_ , and the _HR Review_. _Physical Review_ ,
recognized internationally as among the best and well known journals of
physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 before being later managed by the
American Physical Society.

## Research[edit]

Cornell's Center for Advanced Computing was one of the five original centers
of the NSF's Supercomputer Centers Program.

Cornell, a research university, is ranked fourth in the world in producing the
largest number of graduates who go on to pursue PhDs in engineering or the
natural sciences at American institutions, and fifth in the world in producing
graduates who pursue PhDs at American institutions in any field.[166] Research
is a central element of the university's mission; in 2009 Cornell spent $671
million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest
in the United States.[167]

For the 2004–05 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3 million on
research.[168] The primary recipients of this funding were the colleges of
Medicine ($164.2 million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5 million),
Arts and Sciences ($80.3 million), and Engineering ($64.8 million).[168] The
money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0
million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the Department of
Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation that make up,
respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the
university.[168] Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities
receiving the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five
institutions in forming start-up companies.[169] In 2004–05, Cornell received
200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77
commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1
million to Cornell units and inventors.[10]

Since 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to Mars.[170] In
the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission.
Cornell's Steve Squyres, Principal Investigator for the Athena Science
Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection
features for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.[171] Jet Propulsion Laboratory
engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The
rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life
expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004
Breakthrough of the Year honors by _Science_.[172] Control of the Mars rovers
has shifted between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and Cornell's
Space Sciences Building.[173] Further, Cornell researchers discovered the
rings around the planet Uranus,[174] and Cornell built and operated the
telescope at Arecibo Observatory located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico until 2011,
when they transferred the operations to SRI International, the Universities
Space Research Association and the Metropolitan University of Puerto
Rico.[175]

The Automotive Crash Injury Research Project was begun in 1952.[176] It
pioneered the use of crash testing, originally using corpses rather than
dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing
steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an
extraordinary percentage of injuries.[176]

In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two
IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. In
1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new
supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to
provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States.
As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel
supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and
deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell
deployed Red Cloud, one of the first cloud computing services designed
specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National
Science Foundation XSEDE supercomputing program, providing coordination for
XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online
training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.[177]

Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for
more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not
only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the
Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). In the
1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s,
Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the
1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was
the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.[178][179] After
building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence
to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and
building the largest accelerator in the United States.[180] Cornell's
accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the
proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its
construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed
in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on
questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra
dimensions.[181]

In the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being
one of the world's greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia. The
Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a National Resource
Center (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010–2014.
Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign
language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and
applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia.[182] The George McTurnan Kahin
Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is located in the historic
"Treman House."[183] The house was built by Robert Henry Treman, the son of an
enterprising local family and the first member of that family to attend
Cornell University and be elected to its board of trustees. The George
McTurnan Kahin Center is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and
scholars, faculty members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices.[184]

## Student life[edit]

### Activities[edit]

Friday night

For the 2016-17 academic year, Cornell had over 1,000 registered student
organizations. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to
full-armor jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to
improvisational theatre, from political clubs and publications to chess and
video game clubs.[185] The Cornell International Affairs Society sends over
100 Cornellians to collegiate Model United Nations conferences across North
America and hosts the Cornell Model United Nations Conference each spring for
over 500 high school students. Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs
Society's traveling Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the
nation.[186] Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many
diverse religious traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources
throughout a student's time at college. The Cornell Catholic Community is the
largest Catholic student organization on campus. Student organizations also
include a myriad of groups including a symphony orchestra,[187] concert
bands,[188] formal and informal choral groups,[189] including the Sherwoods
and Cayuga's Waiters (a pun on the first line of the alma mater, "Far above
Cayuga's waters . . . ") and other musical groups that play everything from
classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition to the Big Red Marching Band,
which performs regularly at football games and other campus events.[190]
Organized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student organization is the Cornell
University Glee Club.[191] A Cornell student organization, The Cornell
Astronomical Society, runs public observing nights every Friday evening at the
Fuertes Observatory. The university is home to the Telluride House, an
intellectual residential society. The university is also home to three secret
honor societies called Sphinx Head,[192] Der Hexenkreis and Quill and
Dagger[193][194] that have maintained a presence on campus for well over 120
years.

Cornell's clubs are primarily subsidized financially by the Student Assembly
and the Graduate & Professional Student Assembly, two student-run
organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.[195][196] The
assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert
commission and an on-campus theater.

### Greek life, professional, and honor societies[edit]

Main article: List of fraternities and sororities at Cornell University

Cornell hosts a large fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters
involving 33% of male and 24% of female undergraduates.[197][198][199] Alpha
Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter organization established for
African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.[200][201] Alpha Zeta
Fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin
Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1,
1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that
came to the United States to study. This organization led a movement of
fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was
active from 1890 to 1975.[202] On February 19, 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda
Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established;[203] it would eventually become the
only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League
institution.[ _citation needed_ ] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi
sorority was established on April 16, 1988, making the organization the first
Latina-Based, and not Latina exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league
institution.[204]

Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many
chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as
evidenced by the proliferation of _Alpha-series_ chapters. The chapter house
of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built
in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was
designed by John Russell Pope.[205] Philanthropy opportunities are used to
encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year,
the Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and
raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic
efforts.[198] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek
governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more
serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers
Cornell's justice system.[198]

###  Press and radio[edit]

The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio.
Student-run newspapers include _The Cornell Daily Sun_ , an independent daily;
_The Cornell Review_ , a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and
_The Cornell Progressive (newspaper)_ , a liberal newspaper published every
month.

Other press outlets include _The Cornell Lunatic_ , a campus humor magazine;
the _Cornell Chronicle_ , the university's newspaper of record; and _Kitsch
Magazine_ , a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College.
_The Cornellian_ is an independent student organization that organizes,
arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is
composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and of
the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for
Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy
League Yearbook with such a distinction.[206] Cornellians are represented over
the radio waves on WVBR, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and
operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet
streaming audio sites.[207]

###  Housing[edit]

housing to academic buildings on campus

University housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West
Campus, and Collegetown. Since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus
houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost
entirely populated by freshmen.[208]

The only options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program
houses and co-op houses: Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the
Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the Multicultural Living
Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, and Ujamaa. In an attempt
to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the
classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million
reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for
undergraduates.[209] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in
part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually
operating residential college at Cornell.[210]

Additionally, Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional
students. Of these, Schuyler House (which was formerly a part of Sage
Infirmary)[211] has a dorm layout, while Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck
Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even
allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East
Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to
apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment
complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate
students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester
freshmen are not permitted to join them.[212] Cornell's Greek system has 67
chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students.
About 42% of Greek members live in their houses.[213] Housing cooperatives or
other independent living units exist, including Watermargin, Telluride House,
Triphammer Cooperative, the Center for Jewish Living, the Wait Cooperative,
Von Cramm Cooperative Hall, and Cayuga Lodge.[214] Besides this there exists
also cooperative housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma Alpha or Stewart
Little.

As of 2014[update], Cornell's dining system was ranked 3rd in the nation by
the _Princeton Review_.[215] The university has 30 on-campus dining locations,
and a program called the Cross Country Gourmet Guest Restaurant Series
periodically brings chefs, menus, and atmosphere from restaurants to Cornell's
ten cafeterias.[216]

Main article: Cornell Big Red

Cornell has 36 varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big
Red. An NCAA Division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and
ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC),
the largest athletic conference in North America.[217] (ECAC Hockey is no
longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic teams
consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports,
including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the
women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is
governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not
offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[218]

Cornell University's football team had at least a share of the national
championship four times before 1940[219][220] and has won the Ivy League
championship three times, last in 1990.[221]

### Cornell Outdoor Education[edit]

Cornell University runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education
programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year. The program
runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and
Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing,
Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[222] COE also runs one of the largest
pre-freshman summer programs known as Outdoor Odyssey.[223] Most classes are
often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward
Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[224]

One of the most remarkable facilities at Cornell Outdoor Education is The
Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall is the largest indoor natural rock climbing
wall in North America, covering the entire east end of Bartels Hall, and is
160' wide and 30' high, for a total of 4,800 square feet of climbing
surface.[225] Over the past year, COE has been extensively fundraising to
fully upgrade and modernize the wall.[226]

### Cornelliana[edit]

A tradition started in 1901, Dragon Day celebrates a feat by first-year
architecture students to construct a colossal dragon to be paraded to center
campus and then burned.

Main article: Cornelliana

Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian
traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the last day of classes of
the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which includes the burning of a dragon
built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest
traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near
St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students,
and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week
before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad
and then set afire.[227]

According to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the
statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their
pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating
themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a
couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does
not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is
accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.[228]

The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at
least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd
atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg)
pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire
atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[229] The
colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green
for St. Patrick's Day.[230] The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on
"Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the
unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot
"Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during
football games.[6] The university's alma mater is "Far Above Cayuga's Waters",
and its fight song is "Give My Regards to Davy". People associated with the
university are called "Cornellians".

### Health[edit]

Cornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to
students.[231] Gannett Clinic offers on-campus outpatient health services with
emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical
Center.[232] For most of its history, Cornell provided residential medical
care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.[233] Cornell
offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.[234] The
university also has a student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency. The
squad provides emergency response to medical emergencies on Cornell University
campus and surrounding university-owned properties. Cornell EMS also provides
stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, First Aid and other
training seminars to the Cornell community.[235]

The university received worldwide attention for a series of six student
suicides by jumping into a gorge that occurred during the 2009–10 school year,
and they have since added temporary fences to the bridges which span its
gorges while more permanent measures are in process. There were cases of
gorge-jumping in the 1970s and 1990s.[236] Before this abnormal cluster of
suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide
rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008
in which no suicides occurred.[237][238]

### Campus police[edit]

Cornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace
officers and have the same authority as the Ithaca city police. They are
similar to the campus police at Ithaca College and Syracuse University because
those campus police are classified as armed peace officers. The Cornell
University Police are on campus and on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Their duties include: patrolling the university around the clock, responding
to emergency situations and to non-emergency calls for service, crime
prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of
state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.[239][ _non-

## People[edit]

See also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Cornell University

Cornell counts numerous notable individuals who have either come to the
university as faculty to teach and to conduct research, or as students who
have gone on to do noteworthy things. In total, 54 Nobel laureates were either
faculty or students at Cornell.[11]

### Faculty[edit]

1916 Cornell faculty

Main article: List of Cornell University faculty

As of 2009[update], Cornell had 1,639 full-and part-time faculty members
affiliated with its main campus,[10] 1,235 affiliated with its New York City
divisions, and 34 affiliated with its campus in Qatar.[10] Cornell's faculty

Kurt Lewin taught at Cornell from 1933 to 1935 and is considered the "father
of social psychology".[240] Norman Borlaug taught at the university from 1982
to 1988 and is considered the "father of the Green Revolution",[241] being
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
Congressional Gold Medal, and 49 honorary doctorates.[242] Frances Perkins
joined the Cornell faculty in 1952 after serving as the first female member of
the United States Cabinet and served until her death in 1965. Perkins was a
witness to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in her adolescence and went on
to champion the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act,
and the Social Security Act while United States Secretary of Labor.
Buckminster Fuller was a visiting professor at Cornell for one year
(1952),[243] and Henry Louis Gates, African American Studies scholar and
subject of an arrest controversy and White House "Beer Summit", taught at
Cornell from 1985 to 1989.[244] Plant genetics pioneer Ray Wu invented the
first method for sequencing DNA, considered a major breakthrough in genetics
as it has enabled researchers to more closely understand how genes
work.[245][246] Emmy Award-winning actor John Cleese, known for his roles in
_Monty Python_ , _James Bond_ , _Harry Potter_ and _Shrek_ , has taught at
Cornell since 1999.[247] Charles Evans Hughes taught in the law school from
1893 to 1895 before becoming Governor of New York, United States Secretary of
State, and Chief Justice of the United States.[248] Georgios Papanikolaou, who
taught at Cornell's medical school from 1913 to 1961, invented the Pap smear
test for cervical cancer.[249] Robert C. Baker ('43), widely credited for
inventing the chicken nugget, taught at Cornell from 1957 to 1989. Carl Sagan
was a professor at the university from 1968 to 1996.[250] He narrated and co-
wrote the PBS series _Cosmos_ , the Emmy Award- and Peabody Award-winning show
that became the most watched series in public-television history. He also
wrote the novel _Contact_ , the basis for a 1997 film of the same name, and he
won a Pulitzer Prize for his novel _The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the
Evolution of Human Intelligence_. M. H. Abrams is a professor emeritus of
English and was the founding editor of _The Norton Anthology of English
Literature_.[251] James L. Hoard, a scientist who worked on the Manhattan
Project

Vladimir Nabokov taught Russian and European literature at Cornell between
1948 and 1959.[ _citation needed_ ]

Cornell has twice (2008 and 2009) been named a "Great College to Work For" by
The Chronicle of Higher Education, due to receiving high ratings in
compensation and benefits, connection to institution and pride, faculty-
administration relations, job satisfaction, and post-retirement benefits.[252]
Many faculty, and president, live in the upscale suburb of Cayuga Heights,
directly north of campus.

  2. **^** The University's charter was amended on April 24, 1867, to specify alumni-elected trustees; (Waterman Thomas Hewett; Frank R. Holmes; Lewis A. Williams (1905). _Cornell University, a history, Volume 1_. University Publishing Society. p. 278. Retrieved  December 14, 2010. ) however, that provision was not implemented until there were at least 100 alumni ((State), New York (1881). _The revised statutes of the State of New York_. p. 537. Retrieved  December 14, 2010.  ) in 1872. (Frank Hatch Kasson; Frank Herbert Palmer; Raymond P. Palmer; Project Innovation (September 1901). _Education, Volume 22_. pp. 108–09. Retrieved  December 14, 2010. ) Also in 1865, the election of the Harvard University Board of Overseers was shifted to alumni voting.
