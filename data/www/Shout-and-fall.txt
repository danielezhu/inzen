Shout-and-fall or tumbling strain is a modal frame, "very common in Afro-American-derived styles" and are featured in songs such as "Shake, Rattle and Roll" and "My Generation".
"Gesturally, it suggests 'affective outpouring', 'self-offering of the body', 'emptying and relaxation'." The frame may be thought of as a deep structure common to the varied surface structures of songs in which it occurs.
