"NoMa" (North of Massachusetts Avenue) is a moniker for the area North of Massachusetts Avenue located north and east of Union Station in Washington, D.C., United States. NoMa includes the neighborhoods of Truxton Circle, Sursum Corda, Eckington, and Near Northeast and includes a section historically known as Swampoodle. Its southern tip is four blocks from Capitol Hill. "NoMa," meaning "north of Massachusetts Avenue," is a syllabic abbreviation on the model of other similarly named neighborhoods such as SoHo and Tribeca.
After much planning for the area in the late 1990s, the 2004 opening of the New York Ave-Florida Ave Metro, now NoMa-Gallaudet U station sparked development in the neighborhood. The area is served by many modes of transportation including rail (via the Red Line of the Washington Metro), bus (via intercity carriers and Metrobus), bicycle (including bicycle lanes and Capital Bikeshare stations), Metropolitan Branch Trail), car, taxi, or walk the sidewalks of an area that received a walkscore of 92. Eighteen schools serve the NoMa neighborhood, from pre-K to university.
NoMa includes several historic structures: the Woodward & Lothrop Service Warehouse (on the National Register of Historic Places), the Uline Arena, St. Aloysius Church, Gonzaga College High School, Gallaudet University, and the Government Printing Office building.
