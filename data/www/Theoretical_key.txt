In music theory, a theoretical key or impossible key is a key whose key signature has at least one double-flat or double-sharp.
Double-flats and double-sharps are often used as accidentals, but placing them in the key signature (in music that uses equal temperament) make the music generally impractical to read.
For example, the key of G♯ major is a key of this type, because its corresponding key signature has an F (on its leading-tone). An equal-tempered scale of G♯ major comprises the same pitches as the A♭ major scale, so that the two scales sound exactly the same; such key pairs are said to be enharmonically equivalent. Consequently, the theoretical key of G♯ major is usually notated as A♭ major.
Even when enharmonic equivalence is not resorted to, it is more common to use either no key signature or one with single-sharps and to provide accidentals as needed for the Fs, than to incorporate double-sharps into the key signature. Nevertheless, examples of the latter can be found (see below).
