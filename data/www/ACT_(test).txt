The **ACT** (/ eɪ siː tiː/; originally an abbreviation of **American College
Testing** )[10] is a standardized test used for college admissions in the
United States. It was first introduced in November 1959 by University of Iowa
professor Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT).[11] It is now administered by ACT, a nonprofit
organization of the same name.[10]

The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social
Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989 however, the Social Studies test was
changed into a Reading section (which included a Social Studies subsection)
and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with
more emphasis on problem solving skills.[12] In February 2005, an optional
Writing test was added to the ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took
place later in March of the same year. In 2013, ACT announced that students
would be able to take the ACT by computer starting in the spring of 2015. The
test will continue to be offered in the paper format for schools that are not
ready to transition to computer testing.[13]

The ACT has seen a gradual increase in the number of test takers since its
inception, and in 2011 the ACT surpassed the SAT for the first time in total
test takers; that year, 1,666,017 students took the ACT and 1,664,479 students
took the SAT.[14] All four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. accept
the ACT,[15] but different institutions place different emphases on
standardized tests such as the ACT, compared to other factors of evaluation
such as class rank, GPA, and extracurricular activities.

The main four tests are scored individually on a scale of 1–36, and a
composite score is provided which is the rounded whole number average of the
four scores.

## Function[edit]

ACT, Inc. says that the ACT assessment measures high school students' general
educational development and their capability to complete college-level work
with the multiple choice tests covering four skill areas: English,
mathematics, reading, and science. The optional Writing Test measures skill in
planning and writing a short essay.[16] Specifically, ACT states that its
scores provide an indicator of "college readiness," and that scores in each of
the subtests correspond to skills in entry-level college courses in English,
algebra, social science, humanities, and biology.[17] According to a research
study conducted by ACT, Inc., in 2003, a relationship was found between a
student's ACT composite score and the possibility of his or her earning a
college degree.[18]

To develop the test, ACT incorporates the objectives for instruction for
middle and high schools throughout the United States, reviews approved
textbooks for subjects taught in Grades 7–12, and surveys educators on which
knowledge skills are relevant to success in postsecondary education. ACT
publishes a technical manual that summarizes studies conducted of its validity
in predicting freshman GPA, equating different high school GPAs, and measuring
educational achievement.[19]

Colleges use the ACT and the SAT because there are substantial differences in
funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due
to American federalism, local control, and the prevalence of private,
distance, home schooled students, and a lack of a rigorous college entrance
examination system like those used in some other countries. ACT/SAT scores are
used to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put
local data—such as course work, grades, and class rank—in a national
perspective.[20][ _citation needed_ ]

The majority of colleges do not indicate a preference for the SAT or ACT exams
and accept both, being treated equally by most admissions officers.[21]
According to "Uni in the USA," colleges that also require students to take the
SAT Subject Tests do so regardless of whether the candidate took the SAT or
ACT;[21] however, some colleges accept the ACT in place of the SAT subject
tests[22] and some accept the optional ACT Writing section in place of a SAT
Subject Test.[23]

Most colleges use ACT scores as only one factor in their admission process. A
sampling of ACT admissions scores shows that the 75th percentile composite
score was 24.1 at public four-year institutions and 25.3 at private four-year
institutions. It is recommended that students check with their prospective
institutions directly to understand ACT admissions requirements.

In addition, some states have used the ACT to assess the performance of
schools, and require all high school students to take the ACT, regardless of
whether they are college bound. Colorado and Illinois have incorporated the
ACT as part of their mandatory testing program since 2001. Michigan has
required the ACT since 2007; Kentucky and Tennessee require all high school
juniors to take the ACT and Wyoming requires all high school juniors to take
either the ACT or the ACT WorkKeys.[24]

While the exact manner in which ACT scores will help to determine admission of
a student at American institutions of higher learning is generally a matter
decided by the individual institution, some foreign countries have made ACT
(and SAT) scores a legal criterion in deciding whether holders of American
high school diplomas will be admitted at their public universities

The ACT is more widely used in the Midwestern, Rocky Mountain, and Southern
United States, whereas the SAT is more popular on the East and West coasts.
Recently, however, the ACT is being used more on the East Coast.[25] Use of
the ACT by colleges has risen as a result of various criticisms of the
effectiveness and fairness of the SAT.

## Format[edit]

The required portion of the ACT is divided into four multiple choice subject
tests: English, mathematics, reading, and science reasoning. Subject test
scores range from 1 to 36; all scores are integers. The English, mathematics,
and reading tests also have subscores ranging from 1 to 18 (the subject score
is not the sum of the subscores). The composite score is the average of all
four tests. In addition, students taking the optional writing test receive a
writing score ranging from 2 to 12 (This is a change from the previous 1–36
score range). The writing score does not affect the composite score. The ACT
has eliminated the combined English/writing score, and has added two new
combined scores: The ELA will be an average of the English, Reading and
Writing scores. The STEM will be an average of the Math and Science
scores.[26][27] All of the changes that have been listed for the writing score
and the new ELA and STEM scores were effective starting on the September 2015
test.[28]

On the ACT, each question correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is
no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice part of the
test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a
decrease in their score for questions they answer incorrectly. This is
parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers.
To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who
retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their
scores decrease.[29]

### English[edit]

The first section is the 45-minute English test covering usage/mechanics,
sentence structure, and rhetorical skills. The 75-question test consists of
five passages with various sections underlined on one side of the page and
options to correct the underlined portions on the other side of the page. More
specifically, questions focus on usage and mechanics – issues such as commas,
apostrophes, (misplaced/dangling) modifiers, colons, and fragments and run-ons
– as well as on rhetorical skills – style (clarity and brevity), strategy,
transitions, and organization (sentences in a paragraph and paragraphs in a
passage) – and sentence structure – constructing sentences in a stylistically
and grammatically correct manner.

### Math[edit]

The second section is a 60-minute, 60-question math test with the usual
distribution of questions being 14 covering pre-algebra, 10 elementary
algebra, 9 intermediate algebra, 14 plane geometry, 9 coordinate geometry, and
4 elementary trigonometry questions.[30] However, the distribution of question
topics varies from test to test. The difficulty of questions usually increases
as you get to higher question numbers. Calculators are permitted in this
section only. The calculator requirements are stricter than the SAT's in that
computer algebra systems (such as the TI-89) are not allowed; however, the ACT
permits calculators with paper tapes, that make noise (but must be disabled),
or that have power cords with certain "modifications" (i.e., disabling the
mentioned features), which the SAT does not allow.[31] Standard graphing
calculators, such as the TI-83 and TI-84 are allowed. Within the TI-Inspire
family, the standard and CX versions are allowed while the CX CAS is not
allowed. Also, this is the only section that has five instead of four answer
choices.

### Reading[edit]

The reading section is a 35-minute, 40-question test that consists of four
sections, three of which contain one long prose passage and one which contains
two shorter prose passages. The passages are representative of the levels and
kinds of text commonly encountered in first-year college curricula. This
reading test assesses skills in three general categories: key ideas and
details, craft and structure, and integration of knowledge and ideas. Test
questions will usually ask students to derive meaning from texts referring to
what is explicitly stated or by reasoning to determine implicit meanings.
Specifically, questions will ask you to use referring and reasoning skills to
determine main ideas; locate and interpret significant details; understand
sequences of events; make comparisons; comprehend cause-effect relationships;
determine the meaning of context-dependent words, phrases, and statements;
draw generalizations; and analyze the author’s or narrator’s voice and
method.[32]

### Science reasoning[edit]

The science reasoning test is a 35-minute, 40-question test. There are seven
passages each followed by five to seven questions. The passages have three
different formats: Data Representation, Research Summary, and Conflicting
Viewpoints. While the format used to be very predictable (i.e. there were
always three Data Representation passages with 5 questions following each, 3
Research Summary passages with six questions each, and one Conflicting
Viewpoints passage with 7 questions),[33] when the number of passages was
reduced from 7 to 6, more variability in the number of each passage type
started to appear. But so far, there is still always only one Conflicting
Viewpoints passage. These changes are very recent and so the only reference to
them so far is in the recently released practice test on the ACT website.[34]

### Writing[edit]

The optional writing section, which is always administered at the end of the
test, is 40 minutes long (increasing from the original 30 minute time limit on
the September 2015 test). Essays must be in response to a given prompt. The
prompts are about broad social issues (changing from the old prompts which
were directly applicable to teenagers) and students must analyze three
different perspectives given, and show how their opinion relates to these
perspectives. The essay does not affect the composite score or the English
section score. It is only given as a separate writing score and is included in
the ELA score. No particular essay structure is required. Two trained readers
assign each essay subscores between 1 and 6 in four different categories:
Ideas and Analysis, Development and Support, Organization, Language Use and
Conventions. Scores of 0 are reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic,
non-English, not written with a no. 2 pencil, or considered illegible after
several attempts at reading. The subscores from the two different readers are
summed to produce final domain scores from 2 to 12 (or 0) in each of the four
categories. If the two readers' subscores differ by more than one point, then
a senior third reader makes the final decision on the score. The four domain
scores are combined through a process that has not been described to create a
writing section score between 1 and 36. Note that the domain scores are not
added to create the writing section score.[27][35]

Although the writing section is optional, many colleges do require an essay
score and will factor it into the admissions decision (but fewer than half of
all colleges have this requirement).[36]

### Averages[edit]

Historical average ACT scores of college-bound seniors.

This map shows the mean ACT composite scores of students within the United
States in 2014

For the original standardization groups, the mean composite score on the ACT
was 18, and the standard deviation 6.[37][ _citation needed_ ] These
statistics vary from year to year for current populations of ACT takers.

The chart below summarizes each section and the average test score based on
graduating high school seniors in 2017.[7][38]

Section | Number of questions | Time (minutes) | Score Range | Average score
(2017) | College Readiness Benchmark | Content  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
English | 75 | 45 | 1–36 | 20.3 | 18 | Usage/mechanics and rhetorical skills  
Mathematics | 60 | 60 | 1–36 | 20.7 | 22 | Pre-algebra, elementary algebra,
intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, geometry, elementary trigonometry,
reasoning, and problem-solving  
Reading | 40 | 35 | 1–36 | 21.4 | 22 | Reading comprehension  
Science | 40 | 35 | 1–36 | 21.0 | 23 | Interpretation, analysis, evaluation,
reasoning, and problem-solving  
Optional Writing Test (not included in composite score) | 1 essay prompt | 40
| 1–12 | 6.5 |  | Writing skills  
Composite |  |  | 1–36 | 21.0 |  | Average (mean) of all section scores except
Writing

### College admissions[edit]

The ACT Assessment Student Report, at ACT.org, provides the typical ACT
Composite averages for college and universities admission policies. They
caution that, "because admission policies vary across colleges, the score
ranges should be considered rough guidelines." Following is a list of the
average composite scores that typically are accepted at colleges or
universities.[40]

  * **Highly selective** (majority of accepted freshmen in top 10% of high school graduating class): scores **27–30**
  * **Selective** (majority of accepted freshmen in top 25% of high school graduating class): scores **25–27**
  * **Traditional** (majority of accepted freshmen in top 50% of high school graduating class): scores **22–24**
  * **Liberal** (some freshmen from lower half of high school graduating class): scores **18–21**
  * **Open** (all high school graduates accepted, to limit of capacity): scores **17–20**

##  Test availability[edit]

The ACT is offered seven times a year in the United States and its
territories, Puerto Rico, and Canada: in September, October, December,
February, April, June, and July. (In New York State, the test is not offered
in February and July.) In other locations, the ACT is offered five times a
year: in September, October, December, April, and June.[41]. The ACT is
offered only on Saturdays except for those with credible religious
obligations, who may take the test on another day.[42]

"The ACT is designed, administered, and scored in such a way that there is no
advantage to testing on one particular date or another."[43]

Candidates may choose either the ACT assessment ($46.00), or the ACT
assessment plus writing ($62.50).[44]

Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning
disabilities, are eligible to take the test with accommodations. The standard
time increase for students requiring additional time due to disabilities is
50%.[45] Originally the score sheet was labeled that additional time was
granted due to a learning disability, however this was dropped because it was
deemed illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act and could be seen as
an unfair mark of disability.

Scores are sent to the student, his or her high school, and up to four
colleges.[46]

## Test section durations[edit]

Time is a major factor to consider in testing.

The ACT is generally regarded as being composed of somewhat easier questions
versus the SAT[47][ _citation needed_ ], but the shorter time allotted to
complete each section increases the overall difficulty (equalizing it to the
SAT). The ACT allots:

  * 45 minutes for a 75-question English section
  * 60 minutes for a 60-question Mathematics section
  * 35 minutes for a 40-question Reading section
  * 35 minutes for a 40-question Science section

Comparatively, the SAT is structured such that the test taker is allowed at
least one minute per question, on generally shorter sections (25 or fewer
questions). Times may be adjusted as a matter of accommodation for certain
disabilities or other impairments.

## Score cumulative percentages and comparison with SAT[edit]

Sixty percent—about 2.03 million students—of the 2017 high school graduating
class took the ACT. For the graduating class of 2017, the average composite
score was a 21.0. Of these test-takers, 46% were male and 52% were female,
with 2% not reporting a gender. 2,760 students in the graduating class of 2017
received the highest ACT composite score of 36.[48]

2005 distribution of ACT scores

The following chart shows, for each ACT score from 11 to 36, the corresponding
ACT percentile and equivalent total SAT score or score range.[49] (Concordance
data for ACT scores less than 11 is not yet available for the current version
of the SAT.) Note that ACT percentiles are defined as the percentage of test
takers scoring at or below the given score.

SAT combined score (Math + Reading/Writing) | ACT composite score | The
percentile of students at or below this score for the ACT (not SAT)

## Use by high IQ societies[edit]

American Mensa is a high IQ society that allows use of the ACT for membership
admission if the test was taken prior to September 1989. A composite score of
29 or above is required.[51] The Triple Nine Society also accepts the old ACT
for admission, with a qualifying score of 32; after September 1989 the
