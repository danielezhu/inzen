Bible prophecy or biblical prophecy comprises the passages of the Bible that reflect communications from God to humans through prophets. Jews and Christians usually consider the biblical prophets to have received revelations from God.
Prophetic passages appear widely distributed throughout the different Bibles. Some prophecies in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated. Some prophetic passages present themselves as direct statements from God, while other statements are expressed as the privileged perspective of the biblical author considered to be a prophet.
While Jewish tradition and prophecy differs deeply from Christian prophecy and theology, in general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in exegesis and hermeneutics of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of global politics, natural disasters, the future of the nation of Israel, the coming of a Messiah and a Messianic Kingdomâ€”as well as the ultimate destiny of humankind.
