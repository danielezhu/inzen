In sound recording and reproduction, audio mixing is the process of combining multitrack recordings into a single track and these tracks that are blended together are done so by using various processes such as EQ, Compression and Reverb. The track may be mixed in mono, stereo, or surround sound. There are numerous approaches, methods and techniques involved in Audio mixing; some of these practices include levels setting, equalization, stereo panning, and effects. Audio mixing techniques and approaches can vary widely, and these can greatly affect the qualities of the sound recording.
Audio mixing techniques largely depend on music genres and the quality of sound recordings involved. The process is generally carried out by a mixing engineer, though sometimes the musical producer or music artist may assist. After mixing, a mastering engineer prepares the final product for production.
Audio mixing may be transferred onto a mixing console or digital audio workstation.
