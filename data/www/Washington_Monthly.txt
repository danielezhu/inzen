## History[edit]

The magazine's founder is Charles Peters, who started the magazine in 1969 and
continued to write the "Tilting at Windmills" column in each issue until
2014.[1] Paul Glastris, former speechwriter for Bill Clinton, has been
_Washington Monthly'_ s editor-in-chief since 2001. In 2008, the magazine
switched from a monthly to a bimonthly publication schedule, citing high
publication costs.

Diane Straus Tucker is the magazine's current publisher.[2] Past staff editors
of the magazine include Jonathan Alter, Taylor Branch, James Fallows, Joshua
Green, David Ignatius, Mickey Kaus, Nicholas Lemann, Suzannah Lessard, Jon
Meacham, Timothy Noah, Joe Nocera, and Steven Waldman.[3]

In 2008, the liberal watchdog and advocacy group Common Cause considered
acquiring _Washington Monthly_ , but the deal fell apart.[4][5]

## Contents and viewpoint[edit]

The politics of _Washington Monthly_ are often considered center-
left.[6][7][8] Founder Charles Peters refers to himself as a New Deal Democrat
and advocates the use of government to address social problems. His columns
also frequently emphasized the importance of a vigilant "fourth estate" in
keeping government honest.

_Washington Monthly_ features a continuing blog; "Political Animal" was
written principally by Kevin Drum for several years, with frequent guest
contributions by _Washington Monthly's_ current and alumni editors. In 2008,
Steve Benen took over as lead blogger; in 2012, he was succeeded by Ed
Kilgore.[9] Kilgore left the magazine in 2015.[10]

In addition to "Political Animal," the magazine's website also hosts "Ten
Miles Square," a general blog featuring posts from staff and political
scientists, which debuted in 2011,[11] and "College Guide," a blog about
higher education, which the magazine began offering in 2009.[12]

## College rankings[edit]

_Washington Monthly's_ annual college and university rankings,[13] a
deliberate alternative college guide to _U.S. News& World Report_ and _Forbes
College Rankings_ among domestic publications, began as a research report in
2005. It was introduced as an official set of rankings in the September 2006
issue.[14]

Its "National Universities Rankings", most recently published in 2016, began
as a research report in 2005, with rankings appearing in the September 2006
issue. It ranks colleges on numerous metrics revolving around academic
quality, faculty, and alumni outcomes as well as factoring in "contribution to
the public good in numerous categories".

The following are elements in the Washington Monthly rankings.[15][16][17]

  * Academic quality: a survey of the institution's academic structure, and general program
  * Retention: first year retention rate, and graduation rate of the institutions
  * Faculty resources: average class size, faculty degree level, student-faculty ratio, and proportion of full-time faculty
  * Social Mobility: recruiting and graduating low-income students
  * Research: producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs
  * Service: encouraging students to give something back to their country
