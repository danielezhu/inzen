##  From today's featured article

**Muhammad Ali Jinnah** (25 December 1876   – 11 September 1948) is honoured
as the founder of Pakistan, where his birthday is observed as a national
holiday. He served as leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until
Pakistan's independence from Great Britain in 1947, and then as the first
Governor-General of Pakistan until his death. Jinnah rose to prominence in the
Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In
these early years of his political career, he advocated Hindu–Muslim unity,
helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India
Muslim League. By 1940, he had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian
subcontinent should have their own state. As the first leader of Pakistan, he
worked to establish the nation's government and policies, and to aid the
millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to
Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of
refugee camps. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear
Jinnah's name. ( **Full  article...**)

##  From today's featured list

Church of St Mary and St Michael, Bonds

English architect **E. G. Paley designed nearly 50 new, rebuilt, and restored
churches**. Paley partnered with Edmund Sharpe in 1845, and by 1847 Paley was
responsible for most of the firm's work, carrying out commissions
independently from at least 1849. During the time Paley was being trained by
Sharpe the practice was involved mainly with ecclesiastical work, although it
also undertook commissions for country houses and smaller projects. When Paley
became sole principal in 1856, he continued to work mainly on churches,
designing new ones and restoring, rebuilding, and making additions and
alterations to existing churches. In almost all his designs, Paley used the
Gothic Revival style, initially with Early English or Decorated features.
During the early 1860s he introduced Perpendicular features. Paley was an
Anglican and most of his ecclesiastical work was carried out on Church of
England churches: exceptions include St Mary and St Michael, Bonds
_(pictured)_ , and St Peter, Lancaster, both Roman Catholic, and Clark Street
Congregational Church, Morecambe. ( **Full list...** )

##  Today's featured picture

|

**_Nativity_** is a devotional mid-1450s oil-on-wood panel painting by the
Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It shows a nativity scene—the
birth of the Christ Child as narrated in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke—with
grisaille archways and _trompe-l'œil_ sculptured reliefs. The panel, which may
have once been part of a triptych, was acquired by Andrew Mellon in the 1930s.
One of several hundred works from Mellon's personal collection donated to the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, _Nativity_ was restored in the early
1990s.
