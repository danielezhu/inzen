Day to Day (D2D) was a one-hour weekday American radio newsmagazine distributed by National Public Radio (NPR), and produced by NPR in collaboration with Slate. Madeleine Brand served as host since 2006. Topics regularly covered by D2D included news, entertainment, politics and the arts; contributors included familiar NPR personalities, reporters from NPR member stations, writers for Slate, and reporters from Marketplace, a show produced by American Public Media. D2D premiered on Monday, July 28, 2003, and fed to stations from noon ET with updates through 4:00 p.m. ET. It was the fastest growing program in NPR's history.
On December 10, 2008, NPR announced Day to Day would be canceled with its final episode to be broadcast on March 20, 2009. According to NPR as of December 2008 Day to Day was airing on 186 stations and attracting a weekly cumulative audience of 1.8 million listeners.
According to Dennis Haarsager, NPR's acting CEO, D2D was not "attracting sufficient levels of audience or national underwriting necessary to sustain continued production" now that NPR's projected budget deficit for the 2009 fiscal year grew from $2 million in July, to $23 million in December.
The final data released after March 2008 showed that the program had a weekly cumulative audience of 2,036,400, placing it third nationally behind only Talk of the Nation and Fresh Air for all midday public radio programing.
