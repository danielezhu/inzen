Post-punk (originally called new musick) is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from the simplicity and traditionalism of punk rock to adopt a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Inspired by punk's energy and DIY ethic but determined to break from rock cliches, artists experimented widely with sources such as electronic music, black dance styles, and novel recording and production techniques. Post-punk artists also crossed their work with art and politics, drawing widely on ideas from critical theory, modernist art and literature. Communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines developed around these musical scenes.
The early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, Magazine, Gang of Four, Public Image Ltd, the Pop Group, Joy Division, Throbbing Gristle, the Slits, Cabaret Voltaire, the Cure, the Fall, Au Pairs, Talking Heads and Pere Ubu. The movement was closely related to the development of ancillary genres such as gothic rock, neo-psychedelia, no wave and industrial music. By the mid 1980s, post-punk had dissipated while providing the impetus for the New Pop movement as well much subsequent alternative and independent music.
