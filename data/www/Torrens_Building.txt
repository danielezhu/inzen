The **Torrens Building** , named after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, is a State
Heritage listed building on the corner of Victoria Square and Wakefield Street
in Adelaide, South Australia.[1] Originally known as the Government Offices,
the Torrens Building has been home to a number of government departments for
most of its existence.[2] Since 2005, it been the site of the University City
Adelaide precinct, housing campuses of Carnegie Mellon University, Cranfield
University, University College London and Torrens University.[3]

The building created some controversy in 1880 when it was reported that the
Government of South Australia was going to import freestone for construction
from Sydney, rather than use stone from local quarries.[4]

In 2015, the Torrens Building was offered for sale as part of the State
Administration Centre precinct by the Government of South Australia,[5]
previously having been excluded from the sale plans.[6]
