The baritone horn, or sometimes just called baritone, is a low-pitched brass instrument in the saxhorn family. It is a piston-valve brass instrument with a bore that is mostly conical, like the flugelhorn and alto (tenor) horn, but is narrower than the conical bore of the euphonium. It uses a wide-rimmed cup mouthpiece like that of its peers, the trombone and euphonium. Like the trombone and the euphonium, the baritone horn can be considered either a transposing or non-transposing instrument.
In the UK, the baritone horn is frequently found in brass bands. In concert band music, there is often a part marked baritone, but these parts are most commonly played on and intended for the euphonium.
A person who plays a baritone horn is a baritone (horn) player or baritonist.
