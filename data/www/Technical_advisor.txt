A technical advisor is an individual who is an expert in a particular field of knowledge, hired to provide detailed information and advice to people working in that field. For example, a construction company might hire a technical expert in fluid dynamics to advise them if seeking to move a small water course or a company operating in adventure education will frequently hire technical experts to ensure that their policies and procedures are robust enough to handle the hazards they are going to face.
