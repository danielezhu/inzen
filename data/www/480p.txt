480p is the shorthand name for a family of video display resolutions. The p stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The 480 denotes a vertical resolution of 480 pixels, usually with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels and 4:3 aspect ratio (480 ×  4⁄3 = 640) or a horizontal resolution of 854 or less (848 should be used for mod16 compatibility) pixels for an approximate 16:9 aspect ratio (480 ×  16⁄9 = 853.3). Since a pixel count must be a whole number, in Wide VGA displays it is generally rounded up to 854 to ensure inclusion of the entire image. The frames are displayed progressively as opposed to interlaced. 480p was used for many early Plasma televisions. Standard definition has always been a 4:3 aspect ratio with a pixel resolution of 640 × 480 pixels. Mini-DV, DVCAM, DV footage is recorded at 29.97 frames per second in this standard definition as seen on DV tapes.
480p does not qualify as high-definition television (HDTV); it is considered enhanced-definition television (EDTV). FWVGA is only used for 854×480. FFmpeg uses wvga or hd480 as abbreviations for 852×480.
