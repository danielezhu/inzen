The 80th Birthday Concert is a live album by George Russell released on the Concept label in 2005, featuring a performance by Russell with his Living Time Orchestra recorded in 2003. The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3Â½ stars and states "The 80th Birthday Concert, a two-CD set, stands as one of his finest recordings and sums up much of his career... it is the sound of the passionate ensembles, the very original writing, and the spirit of the musicians and the ageless Russell that makes this a highly recommended set".
