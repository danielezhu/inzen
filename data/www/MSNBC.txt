MSNBC (formerly stylized as msnbc) is an American basic cable and satellite television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from NBC News on current events. The network also carries a nightly "opinion" programming block during primetime hours. MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal, all of which are owned by Comcast. MSNBC and its website were both founded in 1996 as a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, hence the network's naming. Although they shared the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations, with msnbc.com headquartered on the West Coast on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, and MSNBC in the NBC headquarters in New York. Microsoft divested its stake in the MSNBC channel in 2005, and divested its stake in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable news channel.
In the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network, with the entire lineup of progressive opinion-style afternoon programming being cancelled. Along with this, moves were made to sharpen the channel's news image through a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. MSNBC Live, the network's flagship daytime news platform was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day. Phil Griffin currently serves as the president and director of day-to-day operations at the cable network. Pat Burkey, Janelle Rodriguez, and Jonathan Wald oversee programming and news operations at the network, with Brian Williams serving as the channel's chief anchor of breaking news coverage.
As of February 2015, approximately 94,531,000 households in the United States (81.2% of those with television) have received MSNBC.
