The Mass of Paul VI also known as the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite is a form of Mass in the Catholic Church, promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council (1962â€“1965). It is now the ordinary or standard form of the Roman Rite Mass.
The form of Mass in the Roman Rite during the preceding four centuries, 1570 to 1969, is called the Tridentine Mass (including the 1962 version which is now called the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite), while the various forms that succeeded each other in previous centuries are referred to as Pre-Tridentine Mass.
