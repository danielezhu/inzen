**Northwestern University** ( **NU** ) is a private research university based
in Evanston, Illinois, United States, with other campuses located in Chicago
and Doha, Qatar, and academic programs and facilities in Washington, D.C., and
San Francisco, California.[5][6][7]Along with its selective undergraduate
programs, Northwestern is known for its highly ranked Kellogg School of
Management, Pritzker School of Law, Feinberg School of Medicine, and Medill
School of Journalism

Northwestern is a large research university with a comprehensive doctoral
program and it attracts over $650 million in sponsored research each
year.[8][9] Northwestern has the tenth largest university endowment in the
United States, currently valued at $10.456 billion.[1]

The University's former and present faculty and alumni include 11 Nobel Prize
laureates, 38 Pulitzer Prize winners,[10][11] 6 MacArthur Genius Fellows,[12]
16 Rhodes Scholars,[13] 65 members of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences[14] and two Supreme Court Justices.[15] Northwestern's School of
Communication is a leading producer of Academy Award and Tony Award-winning
actors, actresses, playwrights, writers and directors.[16]

Northwestern was founded in 1851 by John Evans, for whom the city of Evanston
is named, and eight other lawyers, businessmen and Methodist leaders. Its
founding purpose was to serve the Northwest Territory, an area that today
includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and parts
of Minnesota.[17] Instruction began in 1855 and women were admitted in 1869.
Today, the main campus is a 240-acre (97 ha) parcel in Evanston, along the
shores of Lake Michigan 12 miles north of downtown Chicago. The university's
law, medical, and professional schools are located on a 25-acre (10 ha) campus
in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. In 2008, the university opened a
campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar with programs in journalism and
communication.[18] In 2016, Northwestern opened its San Francisco space at 44
Montgomery St., which hosts journalism, engineering, and marketing
programs.[19]

The University is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and remains the
only private university in the conference.[20] The Northwestern Wildcats
compete in 19 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA's Division I Big Ten
Conference.

## History[edit]

Main article: History of Northwestern University

The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31,
1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys
who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once
been known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois
General Assembly granted a charter to the _Trustees of the North-Western
University_ , making it the first chartered university in Illinois.[21][22]
The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them
ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first
organizational meeting.[23] Although they affiliated the university with the
Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions,
believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing
territory.[24]

University Hall (1869), the second building constructed on campus, and the
oldest building still standing

John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land
along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would
become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College, opened
on November 5, 1855.[25] To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern
sold $100 "perpetual scholarships" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to
free tuition.[26][27] Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of
the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one
of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire
of 1871.[28] In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern,
and Frances Willard, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the
founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), became the school's
first dean of women. Willard Residential College (1938) is named in her honor.
Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869, and the first woman
was graduated in 1874.[29]

Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later
becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. In the 1870s and 1880s,
Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine,
and dentistry in Chicago. Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law is
the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university increased in wealth and
distinction, and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated
with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research
university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which
gave equal weight to teaching and research.[30][31] The Association of
American Universities invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917.

Deering Library (1933)

Under Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began
construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble
Rogers to house the professional schools; established the Kellogg School of
Management; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus,
Dyche Stadium (now named Ryan Field) and Deering Library among others. In
1933, a proposal to merge Northwestern with the University of Chicago was
considered but rejected.[32][33] Northwestern was also one of the first six
universities in the country to establish a Naval Reserve Officers Training
Corps (NROTC) in the 1920s. Northwestern played host to the first-ever NCAA
Men's Division I Basketball Championship game in 1939 in the original Patten
Gymnasium, which was later demolished and relocated farther north along with
the Dearborn Observatory to make room for the Technological Institute.

before the construction of the Lakefill

After the golden years of the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States
(1929-1941) hit Northwestern hard. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from
$4.8 million in 1930-31 to $3.6 million in 1933-34. Investment income shrank,
fewer parents could pay full tuition, and annual giving from alumni and
philanthropy fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of $331,000 in 1935. The
university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all
employees. It imposed a hiring freeze, a building freeze, and slashed
appropriations for maintenance, books, and research. Having had a balanced
budget in 1930-31, the University now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for
the next four years, which was made up by using the endowment. Enrollments
fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines. But
the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted
Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in
new students and much needed income. In June 1933, Robert Maynard Hutchins,
president of the University of Chicago, proposed a merger of the two
universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million. The two presidents
were enthusiastic, the faculty liked the idea; the Northwestern alumni,
however, were vehemently opposed to it, fearing the loss of their Alma Mater
and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago. The
medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and
feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the larger, research-
oriented University of Chicago medical school. The merger plan was dropped.
The Deering family gave an unrestricted gift of $6 million in 1935 that
rescued the budget, bringing it up to $5.4 million in 1938-39. That allowed
many of the spending cuts to be restored, including half the salary
reductions.[34]

Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by
World War II. The regular enrollment fell dramatically, but the school opened
high-intensity, short-term courses that trained over 50,000 military
personnel. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, and after
the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove dramatic expansion of
both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded
the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind
at an American academic institution.[35] J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as
president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston
campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the
faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student
protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at
Northwestern University.[36] Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were
strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive
student activism,[37] disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law
enforcement,[38] as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus
until 1972.[39][40] Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property
tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of
town and gown tension.

Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s,
President Arnold R. Weber was able to stabilize university finances, leading
to a revitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and
universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President
Henry S. Bienen's tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of
undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty,
and renewed athletic competitiveness. In 1999, Northwestern student
journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death row inmate
Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution, and the Innocence
Project has since exonerated 10 more men.[41][42] On January 11, 2003, in a
speech at Northwestern School of Law's Lincoln Hall, then Governor of Illinois
George Ryan announced that he would commute the sentences of more than 150
death row inmates.[43]

The Latin phrase on Northwestern's seal, _Quaecumque sunt vera_ ("Whatsoever
things are true") is drawn from the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians
(Philippians 4:8), while the Greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open
book is taken from the Gospel of John: _ο λόγος πλήρης χάριτος και αληθείας_
("The Word full of grace and truth", John 1:14).[44][45] Purple became
Northwestern's official color in 1892,[46] replacing black and gold after a
university committee concluded that too many other universities had used these
colors. Today, Northwestern's official color is purple, although white is
something of an official color as well, being mentioned in both the
university's earliest song, _Alma Mater_ (1907) ("Hail to purple, hail to
white") and in many university guidelines.[4][47]

##  Campuses[edit]

University

### Evanston[edit]

Northwestern's Evanston campus is located on Lake Michigan.

Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate
School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north-south
from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road.
North and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres, owing to the
predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in
the other. North Campus is home to the fraternity quads, the Henry Crown
Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities, the
Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, and other science-related
buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication
and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design
Center. South Campus is home to the University's humanities buildings, Pick-
Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings, the Mary and Leigh Block
Museum of Art, and the sorority quads. In the 1960s, the University created an
additional 84 acres (34.0 ha) by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan. Among
some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library,
Norris University Center (the student union), and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall.

The Chicago Transit Authority's elevated train running through Evanston is
called the Purple Line, taking its name from Northwestern's school color. The
Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of
the campus, while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the
campus. The Central station is close to Ryan Field, Northwestern's football
stadium. The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern
campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is
near Ryan Field. Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes
that run through or near the Evanston campus.

Panorama of Northwestern University

### Chicago[edit]

The Montgomery Ward Memorial Building (1927) at Northwestern's Feinberg School
of Medicine in Chicago, America's first academic skyscraper[48]

Northwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's Streeterville
neighborhood. The Chicago campus is home to the medical school and affiliated
hospitals, the law school, the part-time MBA program, and the School of
Professional Studies, which offers evening and weekend courses for working
adults. Northwestern's professional schools and affiliated hospitals are about
four blocks east of the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line. The Chicago
campus is also served by CTA bus routes.

Founded at various times in the university's history, the professional schools
originally were scattered throughout Chicago.[49] In connection with a 1917
master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's
capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of
Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920.[49][49][50] The
architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the
principal buildings on the new campus which he designed in collegiate gothic
style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to
finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building which would
house the medical and dental schools and to create endowments for faculty
chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.[51] The
building would become the first university skyscraper in the United
States.[48] In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to
house facilities for the School of Commerce[52] and Levy Mayer Hall to house
the School of Law.[53] The new campus comprising these three new buildings was
dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued
to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in
1939.[49][54] In October 2013, Northwestern began the demolition of the
architecturally significant Prentice Women's Hospital. Eric G. Neilson, dean
of the medical school, penned an op-ed that equated retaining the building
with loss of life.[55]

### Satellite campus in Qatar[edit]

In Fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar,
joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell
University, Georgetown University, Texas A&M University, and Virginia
Commonwealth University.[56] Through the Medill School of Journalism and
School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and
communication respectively.[57] However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can
truly offer a comparable journalism program to that of its U.S. campus given
Qatar’s strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms and instances of
censorship.[58][59] The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community
Development, a private charitable institution started by former emir Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir Sheikha
Moza bint Nasser, provided funding for construction and administrative costs
as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate
between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.[60][61] Northwestern receives about
$45 million per year to operate the campus.[59] In February 2016, Northwestern
reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the
NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027-2028 academic year.[62]
As with other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received
criticism for accepting money from a country that supports terrorism and has a
poor human rights record.[59][63][64]

### Sustainability[edit]

In January 2009, the Green Power Partnership (GPP, sponsored by the EPA)
listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country in
purchasing energy from renewable sources. The university matches 74 million
kilowatt hours (kWh) of its annual energy use with Green-e Certified Renewable
Energy Certificates (RECs). This green power commitment represents 30 percent
of the university's total annual electricity use and places Northwestern in
the EPA's Green Power Leadership Club. The 2010 Report by The Sustainable
Endowments Institute awarded Northwestern a "B-" on its College Sustainability
Report Card.[65] The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern
(ISEN), supporting research, teaching and outreach in these themes, was
launched in 2008.[66]

Northwestern requires that all new buildings be LEED-certified. Silverman Hall
on the Evanston campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2010; Wieboldt
Hall on the Chicago campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and
the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center on the Evanston campus was
awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006. New construction and renovation
projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy
code requirements where technically feasible.[67] The university also released
at the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year the Evanston Campus Framework
Plan, which outlines plans for future development of the Evanston Campus. The
plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings, but also
discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle
access.[68] Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place
since 1990. Annually more than 1,500 tons are recycled at Northwestern, which
represents 30% of the waste produced on campus. All landscape waste at the
university is composted.[66]

## Organization and administration[edit]

Northwestern is privately owned and is governed by an appointed Board of
Trustees. The board, composed of 70 members and as of 2011[update] chaired by
William A. Osborn '69, delegates its power to an elected president to serve as
the chief executive officer of the university.[69] Northwestern has had
sixteen presidents in its history (excluding interim presidents), the current
president, Morton O. Schapiro, an economist, having succeeded Henry Bienen
whose 14-year tenure ended on August 31, 2009.[70][71][72] The president has a
staff of vice presidents, directors, and other assistants for administrative,
financial, faculty, and student matters.[73] Jonathan Holloway, provost since
August 2017, serves under the president as the chief academic officer of the
university to whom the deans of every academic school, leaders of cross-
disciplinary units, and chairs of the standing faculty committee report.[74]

The Associated Student Government consists of the elected representatives of
the undergraduate students and the Graduate Student Association represents
graduate students.[75][76]

Northwestern University is composed of 12 schools and colleges. The faculty
for each school consists of the dean of the school and the instructional
faculty. Faculty are responsible for teaching, research, advising students,
and serving on committees. Each school's admission requirements, degree
requirements, courses of study, and disciplinary and degree recommendations
are determined by the voting members of that school's faculty (assistant
professor and above).[77]

In 2003, Northwestern finished a five-year capital campaign that raised $1.55
billion, $550 million more than its goal. In 2007, the university sold its
royalty interest in the pain relief drug Lyrica for $700 million, a drug
developed at Northwestern by Richard Bruce Silverman (for whom Silverman Hall
was named), who is the John Evans Professor of Chemistry. This was the largest
such sale in history,[78] the proceeds of which were added to the
endowment.[79]

In 2014, Northwestern announced the "We Will Campaign" with a fundraising goal
of $3.75 billion. As of February 28, 2017, the university has received $3.31
billion towards its goal.

Northwestern is a large, residential research university.[91] Accredited by
the Higher Learning Commission and the respective national professional
organizations for chemistry, psychology, business, education, journalism,
music, engineering, law, and medicine,[92] the university offers 124
undergraduate programs and 145 graduate and professional programs.[6][7]
Northwestern conferred 2,190 bachelor's degrees, 3,272 master's degrees, 565
doctoral degrees, and 444 professional degrees in 2012–2013.[93]

The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of
enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction in the arts and
sciences, plus the professions of engineering, journalism, communication,
music, and education.[91] Although a foundation in the liberal arts and
sciences is required in all majors, there is no required common core
curriculum; individual degree requirements are set by the faculty of each
school.[77] Northwestern's full-time undergraduate and graduate programs
operate on an approximately 10-week academic quarter system with the academic
year beginning in late September and ending in early June. Undergraduates
typically take four courses each quarter and twelve courses in an academic
year and[94] are required to complete at least twelve quarters on campus to
graduate. Northwestern offers honors, accelerated, and joint degree programs
in medicine, science, mathematics, engineering, and journalism.[95] The
comprehensive doctoral graduate program has high coexistence with
undergraduate programs.[91]

Undergraduates with grade point averages in the highest five percent of each
graduating class are awarded degrees _summa cum laude_ , the next eight
percent _magna cum laude_ , and the next twelve percent _cum laude_.[96]
Northwestern also has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta
Kappa (Alpha of Illinois), Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Eta Sigma Phi (Beta
Chapter),[97] Lambda Pi Eta,[96] and Alpha Sigma Lambda (Alpha Chapter).[98]
Since 1951, Northwestern has awarded 520 honorary degrees.[99][100]

Undergraduate cost of attendance for the 2012/13 school year was $61,240; this
includes the basic tuition of $43,380, fees (health $200, etc.), room and
board of $13,329 (less if commuting), books and supplies $1,842, personal
expenses $1,890, transportation cost of $400.[101] Northwestern awards
financial aid solely on the basis of need through loans, work-study, grants,
and scholarships.[101][102] The University processed in excess of $472 million
in financial aid for the 2009–2010 academic year. This included $265 million
in institutional funds, with the remainder coming from federal and state
governments and private organizations and individuals. Northwestern
scholarship programs for undergraduate students support needy students from a
variety of income and backgrounds. Approximately 44 percent of the June 2010
graduates had received federal and/or private loans for their undergraduate
education, graduating with an average debt of $17,200.

In the fall of 2014, among the six undergraduate schools, 40.6% of
undergraduate students are enrolled in the Weinberg College of Arts and
Sciences, 21.3% in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science,
14.3% in the School of Communication, 11.7% in the Medill School of
Journalism, 5.7% in the Bienen School of Music, and 6.4% in the School of
Education and Social Policy.[103] The five most commonly awarded undergraduate
degrees are in economics, journalism, communication studies, psychology, and
political science.[104] While professional students are affiliated with their
respective schools, the School of Professional Studies offers master's and
bachelor's degree, and certificate programs tailored to the professional
studies.[105] With 2,446 students enrolled in science, engineering, and health
fields,[106] the largest graduate programs by enrollment include chemistry,
integrated biology, material sciences, electrical and computer engineering,
neuroscience, and economics.[107] The Kellogg School of Management's MBA, the
School of Law's JD, and the Feinberg School of Medicine's MD are the three
largest professional degree programs by enrollment.[103]

### Admissions[edit]

Admissions are characterized as "most selective" by _U.S. News& World
Report_.[108] There were 37,255 applications for the undergraduate class of
2021 (entering 2017). For early decision, 971 out of 3,736 applicants were
admitted, for an acceptance rate of 26%. In regular decision, 2,400 out of
33,519 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 7.16%. In total,
3,371 out of 37,255 applicants were admitted for an overall acceptance rate of
9.0%, making Northwestern one of the most selective schools in the United
States.[109] For freshmen enrolling in the class of 2020, the interquartile
range (middle 50%) on the SAT was 690–760 for critical reading and 710-800 for
math, ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 32–34, and 91%
ranked in the top ten percent of their high school class.[110]

In April 2016, Northwestern announced that it signed on to the Chicago Star
Partnership, a City Colleges initiative. Through this partnership,
Northwestern is one of 15 Illinois public and private universities that will
"provide scholarships to students who graduate from Chicago Public Schools,
get their associate degree from one of the city's community colleges, and then
get admitted to a bachelor's degree program." The partnership was influenced
by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who encouraged local universities to increase
opportunities for students in the public school district. The University of
Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University, the School of the Art Institute,
DePaul University and Loyola University are also part of the Star Scholars
partnership.[111]

### Libraries and museums[edit]

University Library (1970), in Brutalist style

The Northwestern library system consists of four libraries on the Evanston
campus including the present main library, University Library and the original
library building, Deering Library; three libraries on the Chicago campus; and
the library affiliated with Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary.[112] The
University Library contains over 4.9 million volumes, 4.6 million microforms,
and almost 99,000 periodicals making it (by volume) the 30th-largest
university library in North America and the 10th-largest library among private
universities.[112][113] Notable collections in the library system include the
Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, the largest Africana
collection in the world,[114] an extensive collection of early edition printed
music and manuscripts as well as late-modern works, and an art collection
noted for its 19th and 20th-century Western art and architecture
periodicals.[115] The library system participates with 15 other universities
in digitizing its collections as a part of the Google Book Search
project.[115] The Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art is a major art museum in
Chicago, containing more than 4,000 works in its permanent collection as well
as dedicating a third of its space to temporary and traveling
exhibitions.[116]

In 2011, the Holocaust Educational Foundation, which had previously endowed
the Theodore Zev Weiss – Holocaust Educational Foundation Professorship in
Holocaust Studies, became part of Northwestern.[117][118]

### Research[edit]

Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center (2005)

Northwestern was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1917
and remains a research university with "very high" research activity.[91][119]
Northwestern's schools of management, engineering, and communication are among
the most academically productive in the nation.[120] Northwestern received
$649.7 million in research funding in 2016.[121] Northwestern supports nearly
1,500 research laboratories across two campuses, predominately in the medical
and biological sciences. Through the Innovation and New Ventures Office
(INVO),[122] Northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions, filed 270
patent applications, received 81 foreign and US patents, started 12 companies,
and generated $79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013. The bulk of the
revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin, a synthesized organic molecule
discovered by chemistry professor Richard Silverman, which ultimately was
marketed as Lyrica, a drug sold by Pfizer, to combat epilepsy, neuropathic
pain, and fibromyalgia. INVO has been involved in creating a number of
centers, including the Center for Developmental Therapeutics (CDT)[123] and
the Center for Device Development (CD2).[124] It has also helped form over 50
startup companies based on Northwestern technologies.[125]

Northwestern is home to the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and
Research in Astrophysics, Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems,
Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, Materials Research Center, Institute
for Policy Research, International Institute for Nanotechnology, Center for
Catalysis and Surface Science, Buffet Center for International and Comparative
Studies, the Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern[66] and
the Argonne/Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center and other centers for
interdisciplinary research.[126]

## Campus life[edit]

### Traditions[edit]

The Rock in front of University Hall

The undergraduates have a number of traditions: Painting The Rock (originally
a fountain donated by the Class of 1902) is a way to advertise, for example,
campus organizations, events in Greek life, student groups, and university-
wide events.[127] Dance Marathon, a 30-hour philanthropic event, has raised
more than 13 million dollars in its history for various children's
charities.[128] _Primal Scream_ is held at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals
week every quarter; students lean out of windows or gather in courtyards and
scream.[129] Armadillo Day, or, more popularly, Dillo Day, a day of music and
food, is held on Northwestern's Lakefill every Spring on the weekend after
Memorial Day.[129] And in one of the University's newer traditions, every year
during freshman orientation, known as Wildcat Welcome, freshmen and transfer
students pass through Weber Arch to the loud huzzahs of upperclassmen and the
music of the University Marching Band.

There are traditions long associated with football games. Students growl like
wildcats when the opposing team controls the ball, while simulating a paw with
their hands. They will also jingle keys at the beginning of each kickoff. In
the past, before the tradition was discontinued, students would throw
marshmallows during games.[130] The Clock Tower at the Rebecca Crown Center
glows purple, instead of its usual white, after a winning game, thereby
proclaiming the happy news. The Clock Tower remains purple until a loss or
until the end of the sports season. Whereas formerly the Clock Tower was
lighted only for football victories, wins for men's basketball and women's
lacrosse now merit commemoration as well; important victories in other sports
may also prompt an empurpling.

### Performing arts[edit]

Two annual productions are especially notable: The Waa-Mu Show, and the
Dolphin show. Waa-Mu is an original musical, written and produced almost
entirely by students.[131] Children's theater is represented on campus by
Griffin's Tale and Purple Crayon Players.[132] Its umbrella organization — the
Student Theatre Coalition, or StuCo — organizes nine student theater
companies, multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent
productions each year.[133] Many Northwestern alumni have used these
productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers.
Chicago's Lookingglass Theatre Company, for example, which began life in the
Great Room in Jones Residential College, was founded in 1988 by several
alumni, including David Schwimmer; in 2011, it won the Regional Tony
Award.[134]

Northwestern also has a variety of improvisational groups. The improv and
sketch comedy group Mee-Ow created by Paul Warshauer and Josh Lazar in 1974
lists Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Ana Gasteyer, Dermot Mulroney, Seth Meyers, John
Cameron Mitchell, and Kristen Schaal among its alumni.

The undergraduate students maintain twelve a cappella groups, including THUNK
a cappella, the Northwestern Undertones, ShireiNU A Cappella, and Purple
Haze.[135]

Northwestern's Mock Trial team is ranked 7th in the country out of roughly 600
teams.[136][137]

### Debate society[edit]

The Northwestern Debate Society is a policy debate team which has won fifteen
National Debate Tournaments, the highest number of any university. Famous
alumni of the society include Erwin Chemerinsky and Elliot Mincberg, the
latter senior vice president, general counsel and legal director of People For
the American Way. Scott Deatherage, the head coach, was named "Coach of the
Nineties".

### Service[edit]

Many students are involved in community service in one form or another. Annual
events include Dance Marathon, a thirty-hour event that raised more than a
million dollars for charity in 2011;[128] and Project Pumpkin, a Halloween
celebration hosted by the Northwestern Community Development Corps (NCDC) to
which more than 800 local children are invited for an afternoon of games and
sweets. NCDC's work is to connect hundreds of student volunteers to some
twenty volunteer sites in Evanston and Chicago throughout the year.[138] Many
students have assisted with the Special Olympics and have taken alternative
spring break trips to hundreds of service sites across the United States.[139]
Northwestern students also participate in the Freshman Urban Program, a
program for students interested in community service.[140] A large and growing
number of students participate in the university's Global Engagement Studies
Institute (GESI), a group service-learning expedition in Asia, Africa, or
Latin America, in conjunction with the Foundation for Sustainable
Development.[141] Several internationally recognized non-profit organizations
have originated at Northwestern including the World Health Imaging,
Informatics and Telemedicine Alliance, a spin-off from an engineering
student's honors thesis.[142][143]

### Undergraduate housing[edit]

See also: List of Northwestern University residences

Northwestern has several housing options, including both traditional residence
halls and residential colleges which gather together students who have a
particular intellectual interest in common. Among the residential colleges are
the Residential College of Cultural and Community Studies (CCS), Ayers College
of Commerce and Industry, Jones Residential College (Arts), and Slivka
Residential College (Science and Engineering). Dorms include 1835 Hinman,
Bobb-McCulloch, Foster-Walker complex (commonly referred to as Plex), Elder
Hall and several more.

In the winter of 2013, 39% of undergraduates were affiliated with a fraternity
or sorority.[144] Northwestern recognizes 21 fraternities and 18
sororities.[145]

## Media[edit]

Provost.

###  Web-based[edit]

Sherman Ave is a humor website that went online in January 2011. It often
publishes content about Northwestern student life,[147] and most of its staff
writers are current Northwestern undergraduates writing under various
pseudonyms. The website is popular among students for its interviews of
prominent campus figures,[148] its "Freshman Guide",[149] its live-tweeting
coverage of football games,[150] and its satiric campaign in the autumn of
2012 to end the Vanderbilt University football team's custom of clubbing baby
seals.[151][152]

Politics & Policy is dedicated to the analysis of current events and public
policy. Begun in 2010 by students in the Weinberg College of Arts and
Sciences, School of Communication, and Medill School of Journalism, Politics &
Policy reaches students on more than 250 college campuses around the world.

would go on to successful acting careers performed, including Zach Gilford of
the television show _Friday Night Lights_.[154]

_Applause for a Cause_ is currently the only student-run production company in
the nation to create a feature-length film for charity. It was founded at
Northwestern in 2010 and has raised over $5,000 for various local and national

##  Athletics[edit]

Main article: Northwestern Wildcats

2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship game between the Virginia Cavaliers
and Northwestern Wildcats

Northwestern is a charter member of the Big Ten Conference. It is the only
private institution in the conference, and has by far the smallest
undergraduate enrollment (the next-smallest member, Iowa, is almost three
times as large, with almost 22,000 undergraduates).

Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's)
in addition to numerous club sports.[155] The women's lacrosse team won five
consecutive NCAA national championships between 2005 and 2009, went undefeated
in 2005 and 2009, added more NCAA championships in 2011 and 2012, giving them
7 NCAA championships in 8 years, and holds several scoring
records.[156][157][158] The men's basketball team is recognized by the Helms
Athletic Foundation as the 1931 National Champion.[159] In the 2010–11 school
year, the Wildcats had one national championship, 12 teams in postseason play,
20 All-Americans, two CoSIDA Academic All-American selections, 8 CoSIDA
Academic All0District selections, 1 conference Coach of the Year and Player of
the Year, 53 All-Conference and a record 201 Academic All-Big Ten athletes.
Overall, 12 of Northwestern's 19 varsity programs had NCAA or bowl postseason
appearances.

The football team plays at Ryan Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium); the
basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams play at Welsh-Ryan Arena.
Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats. Before 1924, they
were known as "The Purple" and unofficially as "The Fighting Methodists." The
name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a
writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the
University of Chicago, "Football players had not come down from Evanston;
wildcats would be a name better suited to [Coach Glenn] Thistletwaite's
boys."[160] The name was so popular that university board members made
"wildcats" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body
voted to change the official nickname from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but the
new name never stuck.[161]

The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is Willie the Wildcat. The first mascot,
however, was a live, caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw who
was brought to the playing field on the day of a game to greet the fans. But
after a losing season, the team, deciding that Furpaw was to blame for its
misfortune, banished him from campus forever. Willie the Wildcat made his
debut in 1933 first as a logo, and then in three dimensions in 1947, when
members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed as wildcats during a Homecoming
Parade. The Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB) performs at all home
football games and leads cheers in the student section and performs the Alma
Mater at the end of the game.

Ryan Field (1926), Northwestern's 49,000 seat football stadium

Northwestern's football team has made 73 appearances in the top 10 of the AP
poll since 1936 (including 5 at #1) and has won eight Big Ten conference
championships since 1903.[162][163][164] At one time, Northwestern had the
longest losing streak in Division I-A, losing 34 consecutive games between
1979 and 1982.[165][166] They did not appear in a bowl game after 1949 until
the 1996 Rose Bowl. The team did not win a bowl since the 1949 Rose Bowl until
the 2013 Gator Bowl. Following the sudden death of football coach Randy Walker
in 2006,[167] 31-year-old former All-American Northwestern linebacker Pat
Fitzgerald assumed the position, becoming the youngest Division I FBS coach at
the time.[168][169]

In 1998, two former Northwestern basketball players were charged and convicted
for sports bribery as a result of being paid to shave points in games against
three other Big Ten schools during the 1995 season.[170][171][172] The
football team became embroiled in a different betting scandal later that year
when federal prosecutors indicted four former players for perjury related to
betting on their own games.[173] In August 2001, Rashidi Wheeler, a senior
safety, collapsed and died during practice from an asthma attack.[174][175] An
autopsy revealed that he had ephedrine, a stimulant banned by the NCAA, in his
system, which prompted Northwestern to investigate the prevalence of
stimulants and other banned substances across all of its athletic
programs.[176][177] In 2006, the Northwestern women's soccer team was
suspended and coach Jenny Haigh resigned following the release of images of
alleged hazing.[178][179]

In 2017, the men's basketball team made earned an NCAA berth for the first
time in the program's history. They won their first found matchup against
Vanderbilt University, but lost to number one seed Gonzaga in the second
round.[180]

  23. **^** "Keeping the Faith". Northwestern. Retrieved  July 20, 2007. Northwestern's own religious identity stretches back to its genesis. The University began with a prayer — the school's nine founders (all of them Methodists, three of them ministers) knelt in worship before launching their first organizational meeting. During that meeting, they agreed to establish a university under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Through most of its history, Northwestern kept a strong Methodist tie. Regional church conferences chose a member of the board of trustees, and until 1890 every University president was an ordained Methodist minister. 
  24. **^** "Planning a university to serve the Northwest Territory". Northwestern University. Retrieved  August 15, 2013. Although the founders were strong Methodists — three of them were Methodist ministers and before the meeting all those in attendance joined in prayer — they also firmly believed that Northwestern should be institution that would serve all people. At that time in history, particularly in the Midwest, many religious denominations founded colleges aimed at educating only members of their religion.
