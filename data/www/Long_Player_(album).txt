Long Player, from 1971, was the second album by the British rock group Faces. Among the highlights are the live cover of Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed", the wistful "Richmond" and "Sweet Lady Mary", the rave-up "Had Me a Real Good Time" and the opening "Bad 'n' Ruin".
A single version of "Maybe I'm Amazed" appeared just ahead of the album, featuring a studio version of the song in lieu of the live version presented on the album itself.
On 28 August 2015, the album was reissued in a remastered and expanded form, including two previously unreleased outtakes, "Whole Lotta Woman" and an instrumental called "Sham-Mozzal". The reissue used the U.S. cover artwork.
