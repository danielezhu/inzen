The pocket trumpet is a compact size Bâ™­ trumpet, with the same playing range as the regular trumpet. The length of the tubing, if straightened, would measure the same as that of a standard trumpet. However, the tubing is wound more tightly than that of a standard trumpet to reduce the instrument's size while retaining the characteristic sound. The bell is generally of smaller diameter than a standard trumpet. It is not a standardized instrument to be found in concert band or orchestra brass sections and is generally regarded as a novelty. It is used mostly by trumpet players as a practice instrument that can be packed in a suitcase and taken to places where carrying standard trumpets would be a problem. Although not having a reputation as a serious concert band or orchestra instrument, it has occasionally been used by soloists in jazz (e.g., Don Cherry) or other ensembles to add flair and variety.
