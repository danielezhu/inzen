A compilation album comprises tracks which are compiled from other recordings, either previously released or unreleased. The tracks must be from several performers; if from several performers there may be a theme, topic or genre which links the tracks. When the tracks are by the same recording artist, it is considered an anthology, the album may be referred to as a retrospective album. Compilation albums may employ traditional product bundling strategies.
