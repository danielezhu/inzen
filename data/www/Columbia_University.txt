Columbia University (officially Columbia University in the City of New York) is a private Ivy League research university in Upper Manhattan, New York City. It was established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying 32 acres (13 ha) of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.
The university is organized into twenty schools, including Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of General Studies, as well as Columbia Law School, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Columbia Business School. The university also has global research outposts in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Paris, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Asunci√≥n and Nairobi. It has affiliations with several other institutions nearby, including Teachers College (serving as the University's Graduate School of Education, Faculty and Department of Education), Barnard College, and Union Theological Seminary, with joint undergraduate programs available through the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, University College London, Sciences Po, City University of Hong Kong, and the Juilliard School.
Columbia administers annually the Pulitzer Prize. Notable alumni and former students include five Founding Fathers of the United States - one of whom drafted and presented the Declaration of Independence; nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court; 20 living billionaires; 31 Academy Award winners; and 29 heads of state, including three United States Presidents. Additionally, 100 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Columbia as students, researchers, faculty, or staff. Columbia is second only to Harvard University in the number of Nobel Prize-winning affiliates, with over 100 recipients of the award as of 2016.
