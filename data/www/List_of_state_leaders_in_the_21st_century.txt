State leaders in the 20th century – Current state leaders – State leaders by year
This is a list of the leaders of autonomous states in the 21st century (2001–present) AD, such as the heads of state, heads of government, and the general secretaries of single-party states.
These polities are generally sovereign states, including states with limited recognition (when recognised by at least one UN member state), but excludes minor dependent territories, whose leaders can be found listed under territorial governors in the 21st century. For completeness, these lists can include colonies, protectorates, or other dependent territories that have since gained sovereignty.
