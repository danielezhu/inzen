triple j tv (formerly jtv) is the name given to a series of Australian television programmes which started broadcast in July 2006 as a television spin-off of national radio broadcaster Triple J. They are broadcast on ABC1 and ABC2 as well as available online. As with Triple J, it focuses on youth-oriented (18â€“35) programming.
A "teaser" web page and advertisements were released on the ABC in early July. The full site at http://jtv.com.au went live on 27 July 2006. jtv's first broadcast was on 28 July 2006, with the debut jtv live being broadcast the following night: a You Am I concert recorded at the Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney.
ABC TV's Rage music program has re-broadcast selected live concerts of triple j tv in each year since 2009, to make up for the lack of new release video clips available to the ABC at that time.
