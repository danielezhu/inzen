The **American Collegiate Hockey Association** ( **ACHA** ) is a chartered
non-profit corporation that is the national governing body of non-varsity
college ice hockey in the United States. The organization provides structure,
regulations, promotes the quality of play, sponsors National Awards and
National Tournaments.

The ACHA currently has three men's and two women's divisions and includes
approximately 450 teams from across the United States. Teams offer few
athletic scholarships and typically receive far less university funding.[1][2]

The ACHA offers an opportunity for college hockey programs that struggle with
large budgets and Title IX issues, as an alternative to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) financial structure.[3] Sometimes, NCAA
and ACHA teams will compete against one another.[4]

## Policies and regulation[edit]

The ACHA's primary mission is to support the growth of two-year and four-year
collegiate hockey programs nationwide. The ACHA identifies standards that
serve to unite and regulate teams at the collegiate level. The ACHA emphasizes
academic performance, institutional sanction, eligibility criteria, and
standards of play and opportunities for national competition, and the ACHA
promotes all aspects of collegiate hockey stressing the personal development
of individual athletes as well as national recognition for member
organizations. In order to do this, the ACHA has developed organizational by-
laws and a _Policies and Procedures Manual_ to provide the policy foundation
for the organization as it works to fulfill its purpose. These documents are
reviewed yearly at the ACHA's annual meeting.

The ACHA's policies cover team and player eligibility, rules of play, ranking
procedures, national tournament procedures, and other administrative issues,
although the ACHA parallels the NCAA Division III with most eligibility
requirements, recruitment processes, gameplay rules, etc. The league holds its
annual meeting in conjunction with the annual convention of the American
Hockey Coaches Association, in the month of April in Naples, Florida.

## ACHA History[edit]

The ACHA was established on April 20, 1991. Fifteen charter members met during
the Chicago Showcase in Skokie, Illinois at the North Shore Hilton. These
member teams had been playing college hockey for many years but wished to
legitimize its play by standardizing some of its procedures.

The members that created the organization were: Tom Keegan (ACHA), Al Murdoch
(Iowa State), Joe Battista (Penn State), Jim Gilmore (Ohio), Ernie Ferrari
(Stanford), Howard Jenks (California-Berkeley), Jeff Aikens (North Dakota
State), Don Spencer (West Virginia), Jim Barry (Navy), Scott Fuller (Navy),
Leo Golembiewski (Arizona), Ron Starr (DePaul), Cary Adams (PCHA), Jim Warden
(PCHA), and Jack White (UCLA).

The inaugural year of the ACHA was the 1991–1992 season. The goal of the
organization was to create an impartial governing body to monitor national
tournaments, player eligibility, and general oversight. Over the years the
ACHA quickly grew to over 150 teams in three men's divisions.

A Women's Division was added in 2000 with a second Women's division being
added for the 2006–2007 season.

By the 2001–2002 season, marking their 10th year anniversary, the ACHA had a
total of 179 teams registered with 33 teams in Division 1, 100 teams in
Division 2, 18 teams in Division 3, and 20 teams in the Women's Division.

By the 2002–2003 season that number raised to over 250 teams, with Division 3
adding over 80 teams alone.

By the 2003–2004 season the number raised to 278 teams: 40 teams in D-1, 124
teams in D-2, 87 teams in D-3, and 27 teams in the Women's Division.

By the summer of 2007 ACHA membership had reached 360 teams (M1-54, M2-190,
M3-139, W1-32, W2-8), that cover 48 of the 50 states.

During the summer of 2009 the University of Alaska Fairbanks established a
Women's Division 2 team becoming the 49th state in the ACHA. Hawaii is
currently the only state without an ACHA team.

Every year since 2003, the Men's Division 1 Showcase has been an event that
features some of the top teams in the ACHA.

ACHA partners with Fasthockey.com to broadcast many of the league's games.[5]

In 2017, the ACHA adopted a new hosting format for holding the annual National
Championship Tournament for all Men's & Women's Divisions. Then ACHA Executive
Director Michael Walley championed an idea to hold all of the ACHA's National
Championship Tournaments in 1 major U.S. city, in partnership with that city's
National Hockey League team. The inaugural year saw the 2017 ACHA National
Championship Tournament Festival held in Columbus, Ohio, in partnership with
the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets. Then ACHA Executive Director Michael Walley
assumed the role of Tournament Director for the inaugural tournament. In July
of 2017, after undergoing a nationwide search, Russ Slagle was selected by the
ACHA's Board of Directors and appointed to fill the vacant staff position of
ACHA National Tournament Director.

The ACHA includes both Men's and Women's Divisions. The Men's side is made up
of three Divisions: 1, 2, and 3. Division 3 was the last to be established in
1999. Each division has its own distinguishing set of guidelines which are
explained below. The Women's side has two divisions. Division 1 began in 2000
and Division 2 is the most recent addition to the ACHA with its inception in
2006.

Despite most teams non-varsity status, the caliber of ACHA play can be quite
high, especially in Division 1. Many large universities that do not sponsor
hockey at the NCAA varsity level have become powerhouses, such as Ohio
University, Indiana University, and Illinois. Additionally, several
universities that do sponsor NCAA varsity hockey teams also field an ACHA-
affiliated teams. Of all non-varsity sports activities, the ACHA-affiliated
hockey teams generally garner the most attention at their universities, such
as Missouri State where it is the third largest spectator sport. The same can
be said for the Arizona and University of Georgia who draws the third largest
fan base behind football and basketball.[ _citation needed_ ]

All ACHA teams are members of USA Hockey and the American Hockey Coaches
Association (AHCA).

### Men's Divisions[edit]

**ACHA Men's Division 1** comprises 57 teams. Many of these teams compete
against NCAA Hockey D1 and D3 Schools throughout the regular season. There are
seven conferences along with Independent teams that compete annually for the
Murdoch Cup, which is awarded to the Men's ACHA Division 1 National Champion.
Twenty teams compete in the National Tournament. These top-twenty teams are
ranked/selected by way of computer rankings, and as determined by auto-berths
from the seven regular-season Conference champions. At Nationals, teams ranked
1–12 all receive first-round byes, with teams ranked 13–20 matching up 20 vs
13 (etc.), for the rights to play in the second-round in pre-determined
bracket slots.

**Conferences**

  * Central States Collegiate Hockey League (CSCHL)
  * College Hockey Mid-America (CHMA)
  * Eastern Collegiate Hockey Association (ECHA)
  * Eastern States Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL)

  * Western Collegiate Hockey League (WCHL)

**ACHA Men's Division 2** is currently the largest division in the ACHA, it
includes approximately 200 teams in 12 conferences and Independents. These
teams are divided into four Regions (Central, Northeast, Southeast and West).
A total of 16 teams qualify for the National Tournament, four from each
region. Each month of the season a ranking of the top 15 teams in region is
released. After the final ranking in February the top two seeds from each
region earn an automatic berth into Nationals. Seeds 3–10 compete in their
respective single-elimination Regional Tournaments, with the two teams who win
both of their games also earning a Nationals berth. The National Tournament is
a pool play format with the winners of each pool advancing to the semifinals.
The semifinal match-ups are the winner of Pool A vs. Pool C and Pool B vs.
Pool D.

**ACHA Men's Division 3** consists of approximately 140 teams in ten
conferences and Independents. These teams are also divided into four Regions
(Atlantic, North, Pacific and South). A total of 16 teams qualify for the
National Tournament in the same manner as Division 2. The National Tournament
has also been conducted in the same manner as Division 2 since 2010. Before
that it was single elimination and every team played four games. The one
exception is the semifinals match-ups. The winner of Pool A plays the winner
of Pool B and the winner of Pool C plays the winner of Pool D.

###  Women's Divisions[edit]

**ACHA Women's Division 1** includes 23 teams for the 2016–17 season, with all
but independents Liberty and McKendree playing in one of the three WD1
conferences. Eight teams qualify for the national tournament each season:
automatic bids are awarded to the playoff champions of the Central Collegiate
Women's Hockey Association and the Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League,
with the remainder of the field determined by taking the highest-placing teams
from the last of a series of weekly rankings (the rankings are calculated
through a computer component and the consolidated opinion of the WD1
competition committee, with each weighted 50 percent). At nationals, the eight
teams are paired off by ranking (1 vs. 8, 2 vs. 7, etc.) for a best-of-three
first round, with the winners of those series advancing to the semifinals.

**Conferences**

  * Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA)
  * Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League (ECWHL)
  * Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League (WWCHL)

**ACHA Women's Division 2** includes 41 teams for the 2016–17 season, with 27
standing as a member of one of four conferences. All teams are sorted into
either the East Region (22 teams) or the West Region (19 teams). At the end of
the year, the top six teams from each region in the final edition of a
quarterly ranking (calculated similarly to the WD1 rankings, with an exception
being that each region has its own competition committee) are invited to the
ACHA National Tournament. The WD2 tournament differs from WD1 in that teams
are divided into pools and play a round robin to determine the semifinalists.

**East Region Conferences**

  * College Hockey East (CHE)
  * Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference (DVCHC)
  * Independent Women's Collegiate Hockey League (IWCHL)

**West Region Conference**

    * _Note: The CCWHA includes both a Division 1 and a Division 2 conference, with separate groups of teams as members_

##  International competition[edit]

Players are selected from only ACHA Men's D1 to represent USA Hockey in the
Winter World University Games, an IIHF and FISU event. ACHA Men's D2 and D3
division created the Select Teams to offer opportunities for the other Men
division's to experience International hockey and they are ACHA events.

The Division 2 & Division 3 Selects Teams alternate going over to Europe each
year during the Holiday Break to play European teams. The players are chosen
from a round robin tournament in the spring usually in Pennsylvania. The
tournament pits each conference's elite players against each other.

## Logos[edit]

The original ACHA logo was created by Dave Kammerdeiner of the West Virginia
University Art Department under the direction of Don Spencer for a cost of
$50.

In August 2003, the ACHA held an official contest to design a new logo, with
the winning school receiving free registration for the 2003–2004 season. The
University of Washington's Husky Hockey team won the contest, with former
graphic-design intern Tom Eykemans designing the new version of the logo (as
shown above).
