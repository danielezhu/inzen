**Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley** is a branch campus of Carnegie Mellon
University located in the heart of Silicon Valley in Mountain View,
California. It was established in 2002 at the NASA Ames Research Center in
Moffett Field.[4] The campus offers full-time and part-time professional
Masters programs in Electrical And Computer Engineering, Software Engineering
and Software Management,[5] various bi-coastal (split-time between Pittsburgh
and Silicon Valley) Masters programs in Information Technology, and a bi-
coastal Ph.D. program in Electrical and Computer Engineering. One key
differentiator between programs in the traditional Pittsburgh campus and the
new Silicon Valley campus is a new focus on project-centered _learning by
doing_ approach to education.[6]

## History[edit]

After years of planning from the Pittsburgh campus, Carnegie Mellon Silicon
Valley opened in September 2002 under the name " **Carnegie Mellon University
- West Campus** " to an original class of 56 students. Carnegie Mellon had
always had a reputation for graduating bright students in engineering and
technology, so it seemed only natural to establish a physical presence in the
Silicon Valley, the epicenter of entrepreneurship, technology and
innovation.[4][7] James H. Morris, the Dean of the School of Computer Science
at the Pittsburgh campus, was instrumental in establishing the West Coast
initiative and served as the new campus' first Dean.[4] Raj Reddy, a Turing
Award recipient and computer science professor at the Pittsburgh campus, was
the school's first director.[4] In 2008, the university's name was changed to
**Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley** to better reflect the proximity and
opportunity to Silicon Valley. In 2009, Dean Morris ended his appointment, and
the College of Engineering (also known as Carnegie Institute of Technology or
"CIT") at Carnegie Mellon University partnered with the Silicon Valley campus
to bring more resources and a stronger connection to the main campus. In 2012,
Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley celebrated its 10th anniversary.

##  Location[edit]

Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley is located on NASA's Ames Research Center in
Moffett Field. The campus (or in particular Moffett Field), is surrounded by
high-tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, HP, and Lockheed Martin.
Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley currently occupies Building 23 and since
January 2011, a wing in Building 19, which provides space for full-time
masters students, faculty and researchers. An extension for Building 19 has
been in use since Fall 2012.

## Programs[edit]

In Fall 2002, Carnegie Mellon initiated a full-time and part-time Masters of
Science in Software Engineering. The Software Engineering Masters are divided
into a Technical Track, aimed at advancing software developers to senior
positions and architect roles, and the Development Management Track, aimed at
providing software developers with technical project management and
development management skills.

In Fall 2008, Carnegie Mellon initiated the Software Management Masters
program. The program targets senior software developers and managers that wish
to pursue senior management and executive careers. The part-time MS SM program
offers 4 concentrations to select from, in Product Development,
Entrepreneurship, Enterprise Innovation, and Service Management.[7]

For several years, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley operated a long-distance
capability to Pittsburgh's Tepper School of Business.[8]

The campus now offers full-time versions of the MS Software Engineering and MS
Software Management degrees. Both programs are 12-month programs, that are
completed entirely at the Silicon Valley campus. The MS SE program offers the
Technical and Development Management tracks. The full-time MS SM program has a
special focus on software innovation and entrepreneurship.

In Fall 2008, a Ph.D. program in Electrical and Computer Engineering was
initiated, offering students opportunities for advanced studies and research
in the fields of mobility, security, and networking.[9]

In Fall 2009, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley initiated bi-coastal master's
degree programs in Information Technology with specializations in Mobility,
Information Security, and Software Management through the Information
Networking Institute. In the bi-coastal programs, students divide their time
between the campuses in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley.

## Student population[edit]

Approximately 350 students are enrolled in Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley's
academic programs. With its strong technical support for long-distance
learning, about 25% of the part-time student population reside outside of the
Bay Area. However, with its unique location in Silicon Valley, many local
students stem from prominent companies such as Yahoo, Google, IBM, Lockheed
Martin, Oracle, Boeing and Microsoft, providing a vibrant environment with
many diverse corporate experiences.

Over 600 alumni have graduated from the Silicon Valley campus since 2002,
adding to the over 6000 Carnegie Mellon alumni working in the Bay Area.

## Research[edit]

The campus has a growing research effort, which began in 2008 as a natural
growth of the CyLab Mobility Research Center. The research primarily focused
on software mobility, networking and security. CMUSV has now grown into a
vibrant research community with groundbreaking initiatives in wireless
sensors, machine learning, context area computing, security, energy
technology, software and systems engineering and disaster management.

More recently, the research efforts have grown to include Disaster Management,
Language Technologies, UAVs, Antannae Optimization, Health Technology systems.
Cutting-edge research centers include the CyLab Mobility Research Center, the
Carnegie Mellon Innovations Lab (CMIL), the Center for Open Source
Investigation (COSI), the International Center for Advanced Communication
Technologies (interACT) and the Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL).

The Disaster Management Initiative (DMI) was established in 2009 with the
mission to provide next-generation technical solutions to disaster prediction,
management and recovery.

## Silicon Valley Events[edit]

Besides the educational programs, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley has also
organized software-related events in Silicon Valley, such as Carnegie Mellon's
_Tour de Silicon Valley_ , where selected Carnegie Mellon students from the
Pittsburgh campus are flown to Silicon Valley for a week of networking at
various software companies.[10]

Currently, the school offers TOCS - "Talks on Computing Systems", a weekly
talk given by a subject expert in various topics related to software and
computing. These talks are open to the public in addition to the faculty and
students.

The school has also organized in association with the UC Berkeley, regular
software conferences in the outlook of the software industry. Its first
incarnation took place on April 30, 2007 at the Microsoft Silicon Valley
Campus and focused on _The New Software Industry - Forces at Play, Business in
Motion_ ,[11] while the second conference took place on April 22, 2008 at the
Santa Clara Convention Center and focused on _The Mobile Future - Technology
Revolutionizing our Lives_.[12]

The campus has hosted a Disaster Management Workshop, focusing on its growing
research division in Disaster Response. The 3 day event included a CrisisCamp
for practitioners to come and collaborate on improving disaster relief
methodologies.

## The Fence[edit]

In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 presented a gift to the
university by installing their own Carnegie Mellon University fence on the
silicon valley campus.[13] The fence is a Carnegie Mellon tradition on the
main campus where different student organizations repaint a long fence in the
middle of the campus to promote a cause or spread a certain message. Members
of the class of 2008 collected money to hire a contractor to build and install
a 10-foot fence, that was then subsequently painted with images symbolizing
the west coast (like the Golden Gate Bridge, or NASA's Hangar One). The fence
was dedicated to Randy Pausch who died in 2008 (the top of the fence reads
"Dedicated to Randy Pausch"). The remaining money was also donated and gift-
matched to a total of $1000 to the Randy Pausch Memorial Fund.[13]

## Alumni[edit]

Many of CMUSV's alumni go on to work in nearby Silicon Valley companies
including Google and Facebook. ECE PhD graduate Heng-Tze Cheng created the
wide and deep learning system for recommendation system at Google.[14][15]
Faculty Joy Ying Zhang and research staff of Mobile Technologies (creator of
Jibbigo) was acquired by Facebook.[16][17]
