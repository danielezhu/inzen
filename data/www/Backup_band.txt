A backing band or backup band is a musical ensemble that accompanies a lead singer at a live performance or on a recording. A backup band can also accompany an instrumental soloist, such as a lead guitarist or solo fiddler, though all-instrumental performances, with no singing, are not common in popular music and traditional music. This can either be an established, long-standing group that has little or no change in membership, or it may be an ad hoc group assembled for a single show or a single recording. Ad hoc or "pickup" groups are often made up of session musicians.
