The Court of Requests was a minor equity court in England and Wales. It first became a formal tribunal with some Privy Council elements under Henry VII, hearing cases from the poor and the servants of the King. It quickly became popular on account of the low cost of bringing a case and the rapid processing time, earning the disapproval of the common law judges. Two formal judges, the "Masters of Requests Ordinary", were appointed towards the end of Henry VIII's reign, with an additional two "Masters of Requests Extraordinary" appointed under Elizabeth I to allow two judges to accompany her on her travels around England. Two more Ordinary Masters were appointed under James I of England, with the increasing volume of cases bringing a wave of complaints as the Court's business and backlog grew.
The Court became embroiled in a dispute with the common law courts during the late 16th century, who were angry at the amount of business deserting them for the Court of Requests. During the 1590s they went on the offensive, overwriting many decisions made by the Requests and preventing them imprisoning anyone. It is commonly accepted that this was a death-blow for the Court, which, dependent on the Privy Seal for authority, died when the English Civil War made the Seal invalid.
