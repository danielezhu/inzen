"Remember a Day" is a song by the British psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd, written and sung by their keyboardist Rick Wright, appearing on their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets (1968). It was performed live only twice; as an encore in May 1968, and forty years later, in September 2008, by David Gilmour in memory of Wright, who had recently died of cancer. The dreamy, poetic lyrics are about nostalgia for the lost paradise of early childhood.
