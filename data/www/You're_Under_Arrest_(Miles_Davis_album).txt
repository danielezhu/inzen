You're Under Arrest is a 1985 album recorded by Miles Davis that saw Miles mix pop tunes with political statements about racism, pollution and war. Among other tracks, the album features Davis' interpretations of two contemporary pop songs: Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" and Michael Jackson's "Human Nature".
During the recording sessions, bass player Darryl Jones introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis asked him if he could speak French, and since he did, Miles asked him to translate the Miranda warning into French and yell it into the microphone against a backing track.
It marked the ending of Davis's 30-year association with Columbia Records, although the label released the 1984 recording Aura in 1989, and would release many archival recordings in later years.
