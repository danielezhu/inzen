New York City is split into five different county-level administrative divisions called boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. Each of the boroughs is coextensive with a respective county, the primary administrative subdivision within New York State.
Boroughs have existed since the consolidation of the city in 1898, when the city and each borough assumed their current boundaries. However, the boroughs have not always been coextensive with their respective counties. Before 1914, the borough of The Bronx consisted of the southern part of Westchester which had been annexed to New York County in two stages in 1874 and 1895, and before 1899, the borough of Queens consisted of the western part of its namesake county.
