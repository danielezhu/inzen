None is an EP by Swedish metal band Meshuggah. It was released on November 8, 1994, by Nuclear Blast. The band started embracing a more complex approach that would lay the grounds for their later style. The EP is out of print, but the first four tracks are also available on the Contradictions Collapse reissue while the fifth track is on the Destroy Erase Improve reissue. This is the band's first release to feature rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström.
