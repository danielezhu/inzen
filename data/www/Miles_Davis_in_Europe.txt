Miles Davis in Europe is a live album by Miles Davis, released in 1964. It was the first full album by first incarnation of the "Second Quintet" featuring George Coleman, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams, whose first recordings with Davis had made up half of the album Seven Steps to Heaven.
The final songs of the concert, "Bye Bye Blackbird" and "The Theme," were released only on the box set Seven Steps: The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis 1963â€“1964, presumably because the full concert could not fit on a single CD. On the original LP, some of the tenor sax and piano solos were edited, although it still offered nearly an hour of music.
