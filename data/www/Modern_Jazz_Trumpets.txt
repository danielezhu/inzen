Modern Jazz Trumpets (PRLP 113) is a various artists album focusing on bebop trumpeters, released in 1951 by Prestige Records in the new 10 inch LP format. The album features Miles Davis's first recordings for Prestige, as well as recordings by Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, and Kenny Dorham.
The original cover art was a simple text layout, similar to other very early Prestige LPs. Later pressings used the same photo of Davis also used on his first three 10"LPs.
