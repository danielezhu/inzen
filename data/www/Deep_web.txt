The deep web, invisible web, or hidden web are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard search engines for any reason. The content is hidden behind HTML forms.  The opposite term to the deep web is the surface web. The deep web includes many very common uses such as web mail and online banking but also paid for services with a paywall such as video on demand, and many more. Computer scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with coining the term deep web in 2001 as a search indexing term.
