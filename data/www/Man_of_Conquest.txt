Man of Conquest is a 1939 American Western film directed by George Nicholls, Jr. and starring Richard Dix, Gail Patrick and Joan Fontaine. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Score, Best Sound (Charles L. Lootens) and Best Art Direction (John Victor Mackay).
The film marked the first serious attempt by Republic Pictures to break out from its traditional production of B Movies and produce a work of greater cost and prestige. The film is a biopic of the politician Sam Houston, focusing on his relationship with Andrew Jackson and his role during the Texas Revolution. It was inspired by Marquis James's 1929 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Houston.
