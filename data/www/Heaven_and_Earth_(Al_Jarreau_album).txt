Heaven and Earth (Warner Bros. Records, 1992) is the 13th studio album by Al Jarreau. It was produced by Narada Michael Walden and Louis Biancaniello. The album won Jarreau the Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male in 1993. Essentially a collection of R&B songs produced with the artist's jazz and pop sensibilities in mind, Heaven and Earth contains a two-part cover of the Miles Davis tune "Blue in Green," from Davis's Kind of Blue, that demonstrates Jarreau's considerable prowess as a vocal interpreter and scat singer.
