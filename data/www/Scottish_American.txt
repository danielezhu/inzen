**Scottish Americans** or **Scots Americans** (Scottish Gaelic:
_Ameireaganaich Albannach_ ; Scots: Scots-American) are Americans whose
ancestry originates wholly or partly in Scotland. Scottish Americans are
closely related to Scotch-Irish Americans, descendants of Ulster Scots, and
communities emphasize and celebrate a common heritage.[9] The majority of
Scotch-Irish Americans originally came from Lowland Scotland and Northern
England before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland (see _Plantation
of Ulster_ ) and thence, beginning about five generations later, to North
America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.

Large scale emigration from Scotland to America began in the 1700s after the
Battle of Culloden where the Clan structures were broken up and as a result of
the Highland Clearances. The Scots went in search of a better life and settled
in the thirteen colonies, mainly around South Carolina and Virginia.

###  Census history[edit]

The number of Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated to be 20 to 25
million[1][2][3][4] (up to 8.3% of the total US population), and Scotch-Irish
27 to 30 million[5][6] (up to 10% of the total US population), the subgroups
overlapping and not always distinguishable because of their shared ancestral
surnames.

The majority of Scotch-Irish Americans originally came from Lowland Scotland
and Northern England before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland
(see _Plantation of Ulster_ ) and thence, beginning about five generations
later, to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.

The table shows the ethnic Scottish population in the United States from 1700
to 2013. In 1700 the total population of the American colonies was 250,888, of
whom 223,071 (89%) were white and 3.0% were ethnically Scottish.[14][17] In
the 2000 census, 4.8 million Americans[18] self-reported Scottish ancestry,
1.7% of the total US population. Another 4.3 million self-reported Scotch-
Irish ancestry, for a total of 9.2 million Americans self-reporting some kind
of Scottish descent.

Self-reported numbers are regarded by demographers as massive under-counts,
because Scottish ancestry is known to be disproportionately under-reported
among the majority of mixed ancestry,[19] and because areas where people
reported "American" ancestry were the places where, historically, Scottish and
Scotch-Irish Protestants settled in America (that is: along the North American
coast, Appalachia, and the Southeastern United States). Scottish Americans
descended from nineteenth-century Scottish immigrants tend to be concentrated
in the West, while others in New England are the descendants of immigrants
from the Maritime Provinces of Canada, especially in the 1920s. Americans of
Scottish descent outnumber the population of Scotland, where 4,459,071 or
88.09% of people identified as ethnic Scottish in the 2001 Census.[20][21]

## Historical contributions[edit]

### Explorers[edit]

The first Scots in North America came with the Vikings. A Christian bard from
the Hebrides accompanied Bjarni Herjolfsson on his voyage around Greenland in
985/6 which sighted the mainland to the west.[25][26]

The first Scots recorded as having set foot in the New World were a man named
Haki and a woman named Hekja, slaves owned by Leif Eiriksson. The Scottish
couple were runners who scouted for Thorfinn Karlsefni's expedition in c.
1010, gathering wheat and the grapes for which Vinland was named.[27][28]

The controversial Zeno letters have been cited in support of a claim that
Henry Sinclair, earl of Orkney, visited Nova Scotia in 1398.[29]

In the early years of Spanish colonization of the Americas, a Scot named Tam
Blake spent 20 years in Colombia and Mexico. He took part in the conquest of
New Granada in 1532 with Alonso de Heredia. He arrived in Mexico in 1534-5,
and joined Coronado's 1540 expedition to the American Southwest.[30][31]

Scottish-American naturalist John Muir is perhaps best known for his
exploration of California's Sierra Nevada mountains during the 19th century.

### Traders[edit]

Further information: Scottish Indian trade

James VI and I, c. 1604

The Americas in the reign of James VI, 1619

After the Union of the Crowns of Scotland and England in 1603, King James VI,
a Scot, promoted joint expeditions overseas, and became the founder of English
America.[32] The first permanent English settlement in the Americas,
Jamestown, was thus named for a Scot.

The earliest Scottish communities in America were formed by traders and
planters rather than farmer settlers.[33] The hub of Scottish commercial
activity in the colonial period was Virginia. Regular contacts began with the
transportation of indentured servants to the colony from Scotland, including
prisoners taken in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.[34]

By the 1670s Glasgow was the main outlet for Virginian tobacco, in open
defiance of English restrictions on colonial trade; in return the colony
received Scottish manufactured goods, immigrants and ideas.[34][35] In the
1670s and 1680s Presbyterian Dissenters fled persecution by the Royalist privy
council in Edinburgh to settle in South Carolina and New Jersey, where they
maintained their distinctive religious culture.[34]

Trade between Scotland and the American colonies was finally regularized by
the parliamentary Act of Union of Scotland and England in 1707. Population
growth and the commercialization of agriculture in Scotland encouraged mass
emigration to America after the French and Indian War,[36] a conflict which
had also seen the first use of Scottish Highland regiments as Indian
fighters.[34]

More than 50,000 Scots, principally from the west coast,[34] settled in the
Thirteen Colonies between 1763 and 1776, the majority of these in their own
communities in the South,[36] especially North Carolina, although Scottish
individuals and families also began to appear as professionals and artisans in
every American town.[34] Scots arriving in Florida and the Gulf Coast traded
extensively with Native Americans.[37]

### Folk and gospel music[edit]

Main article: Celtic music in the United States

American bluegrass and folk music styles have roots in the Appalachian ballad
culture of the Scotch-Irish Americans (predominantly originating from the
"Border Ballad" tradition of southern Scotland and northern England).

There has also been a long tradition of influences between Scottish American
and African American communities. Psalm-singing and gospel music are a
mainstay of African American churchgoers. The great influx of Scots
Presbyterians into the Carolinas introduced African slaves to this form of
worship.[38] The style of gospel-singing was also influenced by Scottish
Gaelic-speaking settlers from the Western Isles, particularly North Uist.
Scottish Gaelic psalm-singing, or "precenting the line" as it is technically
known, in which the psalms are called out and the congregation sings a
response, was the earliest form of congregational singing adopted by Africans
in America.[38]

The first foreign tongue spoken by some slaves in America was Scottish Gaelic
picked up from Gaelic-speakers from the Western Isles.[38] In a North Carolina
newspaper dated about 1740, an advertisement offers a generous reward for the
capture and return of a runaway African slave who is described as being easy
to identify because he only spoke Gaelic.[39] In one church in Alabama the
African American congregation worshiped in Gaelic as late as 1918, another
indication of the extent to which the Highlanders and Islanders spread their
culture, from North Carolina to Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.[40]

### Patriots and Loyalists[edit]

The civic tradition of the Scottish Enlightenment contributed to the
intellectual ferment of the American Revolution.[34] In 1740, the Glasgow
philosopher Francis Hutcheson argued for a right of colonial resistance to
tyranny.[41] Scotland's leading thinkers of the revolutionary age, David Hume
and Adam Smith, opposed the use of force against the rebellious colonies.[42]
According to the historian Arthur Herman: "Americans built their world around
the principles of Adam Smith and Thomas Reid, of individual interest governed
by common sense and a limited need for government."[43]

Nineteen of the fifty-six delegates who signed the Declaration of Independence
came from Scotland or Ulster or, like the Scottish-tutored Thomas Jefferson,
had ancestors there.[44] Other founding fathers like James Madison had no
ancestral connection but were imbued with ideas drawn from Scottish moral
philosophy.[45] Scottish Americans who made major contributions to the
revolutionary war included Commodore John Paul Jones, the "Father of the
American Navy", and Generals Henry Knox and William Alexander. Another person
of note was a personal friend of George Washington, General Hugh Mercer, who
fought for Charles Edward Stuart at the Battle of Culloden.

The Scotch-Irish, who had already begun to settle beyond the Proclamation Line
in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, were drawn into rebellion as war spread to
the frontier.[46] Tobacco plantations and independent farms in the backcountry
of Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas had been financed with Scottish
credit, and indebtedness was an additional incentive for separation.[33]

Most Scottish Americans had commercial ties with the old country or clan
allegiances and stayed true to the Crown.[47] The Scottish Highland
communities of upstate New York and the Cape Fear valley of North Carolina
were centers of Loyalist resistance.[34] A small force of Loyalist Highlanders
fell at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in 1776. Scotch-Irish Patriots
defeated Scottish American Loyalists in the Battle of Kings Mountain in
1780.[48] Many Scottish American Loyalists emigrated to Canada after the
war.[34]

### Uncle Sam[edit]

"Uncle Sam" Wilson was based on Samuel Wilson.

Uncle Sam is the national personification of the United States, and sometimes
more specifically of the American government, with the first usage of the term
dating from the War of 1812. The American icon Uncle Sam, who embodies the
American spirit more than any other figure, was in fact based on a real man. A
businessman from Troy, New York, Samuel Wilson, whose parents sailed to
America from Greenock, Scotland, has been officially recognized as the
original Uncle Sam. He provided the army with beef and pork in barrels during
the War of 1812. The barrels were prominently labeled "U.S." for the United
States, but it was jokingly said that the letters stood for "Uncle Sam." Soon,
Uncle Sam was used as shorthand for the federal government.

### Immigrants and free traders[edit]

Trade with Scotland continued to flourish after independence. The tobacco
trade was overtaken in the nineteenth century by the cotton trade, with
Glasgow factories exporting the finished textiles back to the United States on
an industrial scale.[49]

Emigration from Scotland peaked in the nineteenth century, when more than a
million Scots left for the United States,[50] taking advantage of the regular
Atlantic steam-age shipping industry which was itself largely a Scottish
creation,[51] contributing to a revolution in transatlantic communication.[34]

Scottish emigration to the United States followed, to a lesser extent, during
the twentieth century, when Scottish heavy industry declined.[52] This new
wave peaked in the first decade of the twentieth century, contributing to a
hard life for many who remained behind. Many qualified workers emigrated
overseas, a part of which, established in Canada, later went on to the United
States.[53]

### Writers[edit]

In the nineteenth century, American authors and educators adopted Scotland as
a model for cultural independence.[34] In the world of letters, Scottish
literary icons James Macpherson, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, and Thomas
Carlyle had a mass following in the United States, and Scottish Romanticism
exerted a seminal influence on the development of American literature.[34] The
works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne bear its powerful
impression. Among the most notable Scottish American writers of the nineteenth
century were Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe and
Herman Melville.

In the twentieth century, Margaret Mitchell's _Gone With the Wind_ exemplified
popular literature. William Faulkner won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1949.

There have been a number of notable Scottish Gaelic poets active in the United
States since the eighteenth century,[54] including Aonghas MacAoidh[55] and
Domhnall Aonghas Stiùbhart.[56]

### Soldiers and statesmen[edit]

More than 160,000 Scottish Immigrants migrated to the U.S. American statesmen
of Scottish descent in the early Republic included Secretary of the Treasury
Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and President James Monroe.
Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk were Scotch-Irish presidents and products of
the frontier in the period of Westward expansion. Among the most famous
Scottish American soldier frontiersmen were Davy Crockett and Sam Houston,
founding father of Texas.

Other Scotch-Irish presidents included James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Chester
Alan Arthur, William McKinley and Richard M. Nixon. Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore
Roosevelt (through his mother), Woodrow Wilson, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Ronald
Reagan were of Scottish descent.[57] By one estimate, 75% of U.S. presidents
could claim some Scottish ancestry.[58]

Scottish Americans fought on both sides of the Civil War, and a monument to
their memory was erected in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1893. Winfield Scott,
Grant, Joseph E. Johnston, Irvin McDowell, James B. McPherson, Jeb Stuart and
John B. Gordon were of Scottish descent, George B. McClellan and Stonewall
Jackson Scotch-Irish.[59]

Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall upheld the martial tradition in the
twentieth century. Grace Murray Hopper, a rear admiral and computer scientist,
was the oldest officer and highest-ranking woman in the U.S. armed forces on
her retirement at the age of 80 in 1986.[60] Isabella Cannon, the former Mayor
of Raleigh, North Carolina, served as the first female mayor of a U.S. state
capital.[61]

### Automakers[edit]

The Scottish-born Alexander Winton built one of the first American automobiles
in 1896, and specialized in motor racing. He broke the world speed record in
1900.[62] In 1903, he became the first man to drive across the United
States.[62] David Dunbar Buick, another Scottish immigrant, founded Buick in
1903.[62] The Scottish-born William Blackie transformed the Caterpillar
Tractor Company into a multinational corporation.[62]

### Motorcycle manufacturer[edit]

Clockwise top left: William S. Harley, William A. Davidson, Walter Davidson,
Sr., Arthur Davidson

Harley-Davidson Inc[63] (formerly HDI[64]), often abbreviated "H-D" or
"Harley", is an American motorcycle manufacturer. The Davidson brothers were
the sons of William C Davidson (1846-1923) who was born and grew up in Angus,
Scotland, and Margaret Adams McFarlane (1843-1933) of Scottish descent from
the small Scottish settlement of Cambridge, Wisconsin. They raised five
children together: Janet May, William A., Walter, Arthur and Elizabeth.[65]

### Aviation[edit]

Scottish Americans have made a major contribution to the US aircraft industry.
Alexander Graham Bell, in partnership with Samuel Pierpont Langley, built the
first machine capable of flight, the Bell-Langley airplane, in 1903.[66]
Lockheed was started by two brothers, Allan and Malcolm Loughead, in 1926.[66]
Douglas was founded by Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. in 1921; he launched the
world's first commercial passenger plane, the DC-3, in 1935.[66] McDonnell
Aircraft was founded by James Smith McDonnell, in 1939, and became famous for
its military jets.[66] In 1967, McDonnell and Douglas merged and jointly
developed jet aircraft, missiles and spacecraft.[66]

### Spaceflight[edit]

Scottish Americans were pioneers in human spaceflight. The Mercury and Gemini
capsules were built by McDonnell.[66] The first American in space, Alan
Shepard, the first American in orbit, John Glenn, and the first man to fly
free in space, Bruce McCandless II, were Scottish Americans.[66]

The first men on the moon, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, were also of
Scottish descent; Armstrong wore a kilt in a parade through his ancestral home
of Langholm in the Scottish Borders in 1972.[66] Other Scottish American
moonwalkers were the fourth, Alan Bean, the fifth, Alan Shepard, the seventh,
David Scott (also the first to drive on the moon), and the eighth, James
Irwin.[66]

### Computing[edit]

Scottish Americans have also been leaders in computing and information
technology.

Scottish Americans Howard Aiken and Grace Murray Hopper created the first
automatic sequence computer in 1939.[60] Hopper was also the co-inventor of
the computer language COBOL.[60]

Ross Perot, another Scottish American entrepreneur, made his fortune from
Electronic Data Systems, an outsourcing company he established in 1962.[60]

Software giant Microsoft was co-founded in 1975 by Bill Gates, who owed his
start in part to his mother, the Scottish American businesswoman Mary Maxwell
Gates, who helped her son to get his first software contract with IBM.[60]
Glasgow-born Microsoft employee Richard Tait helped develop the _Encarta_
encyclopedia and co-created the popular board game Cranium.[60]

###  Cuisine[edit]

Scottish Americans have helped to define the modern American diet by
introducing many distinctive foods.

Fried chicken was introduced into the Southern Colonies by Scottish settlers.
Philip Danforth Armour founded Armour Meats in 1867, revolutionizing the
American meatpacking industry and becoming famous for hot dogs. Campbell Soups
was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell and rapidly grew into a major
manufacturer of canned soups. W. K. Kellogg transformed American eating habits
from 1906 by popularizing breakfast cereal. Glen Bell, founder of Taco Bell in
1962, introduced Tex-Mex food to a mainstream audience.[67][68] Marketing
executive Arch West, born to Scottish immigrant parents, developed
Doritos.[69]

## Community activities[edit]

See also: Culture of Scotland and Culture of the United States

Some of the following aspects of Scottish culture can still be found in some
parts of the US.

  * Bagpiping and pipe bands
  * Burns Supper[70]
  * Ceilidhs
  * Hogmanay, the Scottish New Year
  * St. Andrew's Day festivities
  * Tartan \- some places in the US have their own tartan, and Scottish dress is worn by some Americans to celebrate their ancestral heritage.

### Tartan Day[edit]

Main article: Tartan Day

Tartan Day parade in New York City

National Tartan Day, held each year on April 6 in the United States and
Canada, celebrates the historical links between Scotland and North America and
the contributions Scottish Americans and Canadians have made to US and
Canadian democracy, industry and society. The date of April 6 was chosen as
"the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320—the inspirational
document, according to U.S. Senate Resolution 155, 1999, upon which the
American Declaration of Independence was modeled".[71]

The Annual Tartan Week celebrations come to life every April with the largest
celebration taking place in New York City. Thousands descend onto the streets
of the Big Apple to celebrate their heritage, culture and the impact of the
Scottish Americans in America today.

Hundreds of pipers, drummers, Highland dancers, Scottie Dogs and celebrities
march down the streets drowned in their family tartans and Saltire flags
whilst interacting with the thousands of onlookers.

NYC is not the only large city to celebrate Tartan Day. Large events also take
place in Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, California, Chicago, Arizona,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Québec, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Australia,
and New Zealand.

Scottish Heritage Month is also promoted by community groups around the United
States and Canada.[72]

### Scottish Festivals[edit]

Massed bands at the 2005 Pacific Northwest Highland Games[73]

Scottish culture, food, and athletics are celebrated at Highland Games and
Scottish festivals throughout North America. The largest of these occurs
yearly at Pleasanton, California, Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina and
Estes Park, Colorado. There are also other notable Scottish Festivals in
cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, Atlanta, Georgia (at Stone Mountain Park), San
Antonio, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri. In addition to traditional Scottish
sports such as tossing the caber and the hammer throw, there are whisky
tastings, traditional foods such as haggis, Bagpipes and Drums competitions,
Celtic rock musical acts and traditional Scottish dance.

### Scottish Gaelic language in the United States[edit]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, tens of thousands of Scots from Scotland, and
Scotch-Irish from the north of Ireland arrived in the American colonies. The
province of Nova Scotia, Canada, was the main concentration of Scottish Gaelic
speakers in North America ( _Nova Scotia_ is Latin for _New Scotland_ ).
According to the 2000 census, 1,199 people speak Scottish Gaelic at home.[74]

1 Poles came to the United States legally as Austrians, Germans, Prussians or
Russians throughout the 19th century, because from 1772–1795 till 1918, all
Polish lands had been partitioned between imperial Austria, Prussia (a
protoplast of Germany) and Russia until Poland regained its sovereignty in the
wake of World War I.

2 Russia is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.
The vast majority of its population (80%) lives in European Russia, therefore
Russia as a whole is included as a European country here.

3 Yugoslav Americans are the American people from the former Yugoslavia.

4 Turkey is a transcontinental country in the Middle East and Southeast
Europe. Has a small part of its territory (3%) in Southeast Europe called
Turkish Thrace.

5 Azerbaijan and Georgia are transcontinental countries. They have a small
part of their territories in the European part of the Caucasus.

6 Kazakhstan is technically a bicontinental country, having a small portion in
European hands.

7 Disputed; Roma have recognized origins and historic ties to Asia
(specifically to Northern India), but they experienced at least some
distinctive identity development while in diaspora among Europeans.
