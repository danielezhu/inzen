Sidney Patrick Grauman (March 17, 1879 – March 5, 1950) was an American showman who created one of Southern California's most recognizable and visited landmarks, Grauman's Chinese Theatre as well as Hollywood's Egyptian Theatre, the home of the first Hollywood movie premiere. The film was Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks, and the premiere was the opening night of the theatre, October 18, 1922. He was the son of David Grauman (who died in 1921 in Los Angeles, California) and Rosa Goldsmith (1853–1936). Grauman's parents were theatrical performers on various show circuits.
