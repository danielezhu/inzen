Free Press was a book publishing imprint of Simon & Schuster. It was one of the best-known imprints specializing in serious nonfiction. In 2012, it ceased to exist as a distinct imprint entity and merged into Simon & Schuster, the company's flagship imprint; however, some books would still be published using the Free Press imprimatur.
