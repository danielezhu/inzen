The Dark Knight Trilogy is a superhero film trilogy based on the DC Comics character Batman. The trilogy consists of Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), directed by Christopher Nolan.
Following the critical failure and box office disappointment of Batman & Robin (1997), Warner Bros. rebooted the film franchise. The trilogy stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow.
Each film in the series was a critical and box-office success. The second and third films earned over $1 billion worldwide.
