The Grammis Awards is the Swedish music awards. The awards are considered by many in Sweden as the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. The awards ceremony is generally held each year in February in Stockholm. The awards were established in 1969 and awarded until 1972 when they were cancelled, but subsequently revived in 1987.
The awards are presented by IFPI Sweden, along with the Expressen newspaper.
