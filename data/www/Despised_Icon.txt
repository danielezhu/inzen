Despised Icon is a Canadian deathcore band from Montreal, Quebec. Formed in 2002, the band is notable for its use of dual lead vocalists; Alex Erian takes use of a mid-range growl technique while Steve Marois uses deep growling vocals, fry vocals and pig squeals. In April 2010, the band announced that they would be disbanding and from there, began a farewell tour held across several countries. Their final six shows were held in Quebec City, Toronto and Montreal during December of that year. In early 2014, it was announced that the band would reform and play several more shows in the spring.
