High Step is a jazz double album credited to bassist Paul Chambers and saxophonist John Coltrane, issued in 1975 on Blue Note Records, catalogue BN-LA451. It is a compilation taken from the 1956 Chambers' Music on the Jazz West label and Whims of Chambers, along with two unissued recordings from a session in Boston, Massachusetts, "Trane's Strain" from that session previously appearing on an anthology. Originally, all of these sessions were led by Chambers, but like Prestige Records before them, as Coltrane's fame grew long after he had stopped recording for the label, Blue Note used varied recordings where Coltrane had been merely a sideman, and reissued them with Coltrane's name more prominently displayed.
