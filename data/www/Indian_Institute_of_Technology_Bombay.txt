The **Indian Institute of Technology Bombay** (abbreviated **IITB** or **IIT
Bombay** ) is a public engineering institution located at Powai, Mumbai,
India. It is the second-oldest (after Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur) institute of the Indian Institutes of Technology system.[2]

IIT Bombay was founded in 1958.[3] In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as
Institutes of National Importance.[4] A high-power committee of Government of
India recommended in 1946 establishment of four higher institutes of
technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in
the country. Planning for the Institute at Mumbai began in 1957 and the first
batch of 100 students was admitted in 1958.[4] Since its establishment in
Powai, the institute has physically expanded to include more than 584 major
buildings with a combined area of more than 2.396 gross square feet (550 acres
or 2.22 km²).[5]

IIT Bombay has a comprehensive graduate program offering doctoral degrees in
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.[4] Currently IIT Bombay has
a total of 14 academic departments, six centers, one school, and three
interdisciplinary programmes. Over the last 53 years, around 39,000 engineers
and scientists have graduated from the institute.[4] Educational programmes
here extend beyond the physical sciences and engineering into humanities and
social sciences such as Economics, English, Philosophy, Psychology and
Sociology and into management studies.[6] Over the years, the institute has
also created a niche for its innovative short-term courses through continuing
education and distance education programmes.[7]

## History[edit]

IIT Bombay Main Building

IIT Bombay was the second Indian Institutes of Technology to be established in
1958 with assistance from UNESCO and with funds contributed by the Soviet
Union. UNESCO agreed to provide equipment and technical experts mainly from
the Soviet Union, while the Government of India accepted the responsibility
for all other expenses including the cost of the building project and
recurring expenses. The site chosen for the institute was Powai with an area
of 550 acres (2.2 km2) which was given by the then Bombay State Government.
While construction was being completed, the first academic session of the
Institute opened on 25 July 1958, in its temporary home at the Synthetic and
Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) building in Worli with 100
students. These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants for
admission to the first year undergraduate engineering programmes of Aerospace,
Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Energy,
Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering and MSc Chemistry. One of the main
objectives of establishing the Institute was to develop facilities for studies
in a variety of specialised engineering and technological sciences. The need
for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was
kept uppermost in mind in the founding years.

While the Institute was functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made
to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and
Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10
March 1959.

## Campus[edit]

Administrative Building at IIT Bombay

The IIT Bombay campus is located at Powai,in East Mumbai, between the Vihar
and Powai lakes. The campus is divided into clusters of buildings. The
academic area chiefly comprises the main building, various departmental
annexes and auditoria. All department annexes are connected by a corridor
named _Infinite Corridor_. Beyond the Convocation Hall lie most of the
hostels. There are a total of 16 hostels, of which two hostels (Hostels 10 and
11) and a part of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 15) are for female
students.

Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has
significant green cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest
of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to
occasional sightings of panthers, Leopards and Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus)
crocodiles along the banks of Lake Powai. Sometimes they stray into the campus
in chase of hunt.[8]

The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds;
and tennis, basketball, squash and volleyball courts. It also has a Students'
Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other extracurricular
activities. In addition to these facilities, the campus also houses two high
schools, one of which is a Kendriya Vidyalaya and the other is called IIT
Campus School.

## Cultural and non-academic activities[edit]

The annual Science & Technology festival of IIT Bombay, Techfest,[9] which was
started in 1998,[10] is held in the month of December every year and is Asia's
largest science and tech festival.[11] It comprises various events like
competitions, exhibits and talks from guest speakers from around the world.
Techfest 2009 was also the first event of its kind in India to conduct its
events in other countries.

The annual international conference on the Drupal web framework, DrupalCon
Asia, will be hosted at IIT Bombay from 18–21 February 2016.[12]

The annual cultural festival Mood Indigo,[13] usually held in the month of
December is an event hosted by the student body and is the Asia's largest
college cultural festival.[14] The most attractive feature of this 4-day event
are the influential personalities who have graced the festival like R D
Burman, Aamir Khan, Sir Mark Tully, Sachin Tendulkar, Porcupine Tree,[15]
Simple Plan,[16] Mike Portnoy[17] and many more. The organization is known for
holding the best cultural competitions, games and musical concerts to draw out
the best talent in the country.

Cultural activities like dramatics, Speaking, Literary Arts, Music and Fine
Arts also mark an important feature in the life of a student of IIT Bombay.
Speaking and Literary Arts have always been very popular in the student
community with students actively participating in quizzing, writing and
debating activities. IIT Bombay has won the prestigious National Law School
Parliamentary Debating Tournament.

Apart from cultural and technological activities, the campus is also involved
in business activities with bodies like The Entrepreneurship Cell, which
support the growth of startups across the globe.

These college festivals are organised, financially managed and conducted
entirely by the students of this institute. All these festivals and
organisations are sponsored by private enterprise.[18][19]

Apart from these festivals, various other engineering streams based festivals
are also being organised to motivate students towards Science and Technology.
These include Radiance (Mechanical Engineering), Zephyr (Aerospace
Engineering), AZeotropy[20] (Chemical Engineering), Padarth(Metallurgy and
Material Science Engineering), Aavriti (Electrical Engineering) and recently,
Aakaar (Civil Engineering).

The institute also has an LGBT alliance club called "Saathi".[21][22]
