There are 388 regular municipalities (gemeenten) (January 2017) and 3 public bodies (openbare lichamen), also referred to as special municipalities (bijzondere gemeenten), in the Netherlands. Municipalities are the second-level administrative division in the Netherlands and are subdivisions of their respective provinces. Their duties are delegated to them by the central government and they are ruled by a municipal council that is elected every four years. Municipal mergers have reduced the total number of municipalities by two-thirds since the first official boundaries were created in the mid 19th century. Municipalities themselves are informally subdivided into districts and neighbourhoods for administrative and statistical purposes.
These municipalities come in a wide range of sizes, Westervoort is the smallest at 7.84 km2 (3.03 sq mi) and Súdwest-Fryslân the largest with an area of 841.56 km2 (324.93 sq mi). Schiermonnikoog is both the least populous municipality and has the lowest population density with 938 inhabitants for a density of 21/km2 (54/sq mi). Amsterdam has the highest population with 810,909 residents, whereas The Hague is most densely populated with a density of 6,131/km2 (15,880/sq mi).
