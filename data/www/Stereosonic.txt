Stereosonic was an annual music festival held in Australia in November and early December. Stereosonic was held in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Sydney, and Melbourne. Stereosonic was a collaboration of two major Australia promoters, Hardware and Onelove corporations, and presented a mix of electronic and dance culture music. As of 2012, it was regarded as Australia's fastest growing music festival. In 2016 however, the event was cancelled with the promise that it would return "bigger and better".  Currently, there have been no announcements as to whether the festival will be revived for 2017.
