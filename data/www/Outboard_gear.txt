Musical "outboard equipment" or "gear" is used to alter how a musical instrument sounds. Outboard, (external effects units) can be used either during a live performance or in the recording studio. These are separate from the effects that may be applied by using a mixing console or a digital audio workstation. Some outboard effects units and digital signal processing (DSP) boxes commonly found in a studio are:
analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters
musical instrument digital interfaces (MIDIs)
microphone preamplifiers ("microphone preamp", "mic preamps" or "preamps")
equalizers ("EQs")
dynamics effects units: compressors/limiters, noise gates
time-based effects units: reverb, flanging, delay, echo, chorus etc.
