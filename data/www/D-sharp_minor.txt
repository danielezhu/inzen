D-sharp minor or D♯ minor is a minor scale based on D-sharp, consisting of the pitches D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B, and C♯. For the harmonic minor, C is used instead of C♯. Its key signature has six sharps.
E♭ minor is its enharmonic equivalent. Its relative major is F♯ major (or enharmonically G♭ major), and its parallel major is D♯ major, usually replaced by E♭ major, since D♯ major's two double-sharps make it impractical to use.
Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary.
D♯ minor is infrequently used as the principal key center of pieces in the Classical era. More common is notation in E♭ minor, which is a relatively manageable key for many brass instruments and woodwinds.
