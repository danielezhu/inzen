Imagem Music Group was founded in 2008 by the Dutch firm Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, one of the world's largest pension funds, in conjunction with the independent publisher and media company CP Masters BV. It began by acquiring music publishing rights in a number of catalogues sold by Universal Music Publishing Group, such as Rondor, Zomba, BBC and 19 Music; the sale was worth 140 million euros (US$221.5M in April 2008). These were sold by Universal after the European Commission ordered the sell-off as a condition of its merger with BMG's publishing arm. This was followed by acquiring the world's leading classical music publishing company Boosey & Hawkes in 2008 and Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization in 2009. On June 2, 2017, Concord Bicycle Music announced that it would acquire Imagem for $500 million.
Highlights from Imagem's pop catalogue include Nik Kershaw, Phil Collins, Genesis, The Temper Trap, M.I.A., Pink Floyd, Vampire Weekend and Daft Punk. Imagem has offices in the Netherlands, London, New York, Los Angeles and Berlin.
