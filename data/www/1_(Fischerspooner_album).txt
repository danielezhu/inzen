#1 is the first full-length album by electroclash duo Fischerspooner released in 2001. It originally received a limited run on International DeeJay Gigolo Records, and contained "The 15th", a cover of a Wire song from their album 154. #1 has been re-pressed several times with a different track listing. The title "Fucker" was also censored on subsequent releases, either as "!@*$%#", "*#!@¥¿", or "*#!@Y?".
"Sweetness", "L.A. Song" and "Megacolon", all from the re-issue were originally released together on an EP titled #1 Supplement that was discontinued in time for the first re-issue. A limited edition pressing from 2003 also included a DVD with several remixes, a documentary, as well as four videos—"Sweetness", "The 15th" and two versions of "Emerge".
"Emerge" was listed at #243 on Pitchfork Media's Best songs of the 2000s.
