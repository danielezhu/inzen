Fordham University (/ˈfɔːrdəm/) is a private, nonprofit, coeducational research university in New York City, United States. Founded by the Catholic Diocese of New York in 1841 as St. John's College, it was placed in the care of the Society of Jesus shortly thereafter, and has since become an independent school under a lay board of trustees, which describes the institution as a "Jesuit, Catholic university." Fordham is the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the northeastern United States.
Fordham is composed of ten constituent colleges, four of which are for undergraduates and six of which are for postgraduates. It enrolls approximately 15,000 students across three campuses in New York State: Rose Hill in the Bronx, Lincoln Center in Manhattan and Westchester in West Harrison. In addition to these campuses, the university maintains a study abroad center in the United Kingdom and field offices in Spain and South Africa. Fordham awards the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees, as well as various masters and doctoral degrees.
The 2017 edition of U.S. News & World Report lists Fordham as a "more selective" national university and ranks it tied for 60th in this category. Fordham University School of Law is currently ranked 37th overall and 2nd among part-time law schools in the United States, while Fordham's graduate programs in business, English, history, social work, education, and sociology are ranked among the top 100 in the nation. Fordham University has produced at least 119 Fulbright Scholars since 2003.
