Here's to Life is a 1992 studio album by Shirley Horn, arranged by Johnny Mandel (also the composer of three of the songs on the album), who received a Grammy Award for his work on this album. 
The title track "Here's to Life" became Horn's signature song. The poignant lyrics were written by Phyllis Molinary and are known, world-wide, as one of her finest works. This song is considered a "modern day jazz standard."
"If You Love Me" is her interpretation of the passionate "Hymne Ã  l'amour", made famous by Edith Piaf.
Summer is the first English version of the Italian standard "Estate". Horn ordered English lyrics after hearing Joao Gilberto's version, which spread the song's worldwide fame.
