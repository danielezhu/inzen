Salon is an American news and opinion website created by David Talbot in 1995. The site is owned by Salon Media Group (OTCQB: SLNM). It focuses on U.S. politics, culture, and current events from a politically progressive or left-wing perspective.
Salon's headquarters is located at 870 Market Street San Francisco, California. As of June 2013, its editor-in-chief is David Daley, after previous editor-in-chief Kerry Lauerman stepped down to partner with Larer Ventures on a new startup. Lauerman's predecessor Joan Walsh stepped down from that position in November 2010 but remained as editor at large.
