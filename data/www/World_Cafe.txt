World Cafe is a two-hour-long, nationally syndicated music radio program that originates from WXPN, a non-commercial station licensed to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The program began on October 14, 1991 and was originally distributed by Public Radio International. Since 2005, the show has been distributed by NPR.
World Cafe features live performances and interviews with established and emerging artists. The program's format covers a wide spectrum of musical genres, including indie rock, folk, hard rock, singer-songwriter, alt-country, and world music. The program produces two weekly podcasts containing interviews and information about musical performers: "World Cafe Words and Music," which features more established singers and bands, and "World Cafe Next," which highlights emerging artists.
Since the program's launch, World Cafe was hosted by David Dye. The program announced Talia Schlanger as its new host in February 2017. Dye continued as full-time host and producer of the radio show until March 31, 2017, continuing afterward as a part-time contributor to the program, although Schlanger guest-hosted some episodes in Dye's absence in advance of becoming the program's official host as of April 1.
