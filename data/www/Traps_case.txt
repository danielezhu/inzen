In music, a traps case is a piece of luggage used by drummers and other percussionists to transport miscellaneous instruments, stands and accessories.
A set of cases for transporting a drum kit, for example, will typically consist of one case for the bass drum, one case for the snare drum, one or more for the tom-toms, a case or bag for the cymbals, and one traps case to transport the remainder of the kit, including:
Cymbal and hi-hat stands.
Floor tom feet.
Tom-tom arms, stands or brackets.
Bass drum pedal.
Drummer's stool.
Drum key.
External mufflers.
Miscellaneous small instruments such as a wood block.
Drumsticks, if not carried in a separate bag.
Typically, a kit drummer's traps case will be the heaviest of the cases when loaded, and is long enough to contain a hi-hat stand without collapsing it, to avoid losing the drummer's adjustment of its height setting.
