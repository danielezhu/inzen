The **National Collegiate Athletic Association** ( **NCAA** )[a] is a "non-
profit organization" which regulates athletes of 1,281 institutions,
conferences, and individuals. It also organizes the athletic programs of many
colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, and helps more than
480,000 college student-athletes who compete annually in college sports. The
organization is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2014, the NCAA
generated almost a billion dollars in revenue. 80 to 90% of this revenue was
due to the Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. This revenue is then
distributed back into various organizations and institutions across the United
States.[3]

In August 1973, the current three-division system of Division I, Division II,
and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention.
Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to
athletes for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic
scholarships. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller
schools in II and III. Division I football was further divided into I-A and
I-AA in 1978. Subsequently, the term "Division I-AAA" was briefly added to
delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all, but
that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA.[4] In 2006, Divisions I-A
and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and
Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).

## History[edit]

### Formation and early years[edit]

Intercollegiate sports began in the US in 1852 when crews from Harvard
University and Yale University met in a challenge race in the sport of
rowing.[5] As rowing remained the preeminent sport in the country into the
late-1800s, many of the initial debates about collegiate athletic eligibility
and purpose were settled through organizations like the Rowing Association of
American Colleges and the Intercollegiate Rowing Association. As other sports
emerged, notably football and basketball, many of these same concepts and
standards were adopted. Football, in particular, began to emerge as a marquee
sport, but the rules of the game itself were in constant flux and often had to
be adapted for each contest.

The NCAA dates its formation to two White House conferences convened by
President Theodore Roosevelt to "encourage reforms" to college football
practices in the early 20th century, which had resulted in repeated injuries
and deaths and "prompted many college and universities to discontinue the
sport."[1] Following those White House meetings, Chancellor Henry MacCracken
of New York University organized a meeting of 13 colleges and universities to
initiate changes in football playing rules; at a follow-on meeting on December
28, 1905 in New York, 62 higher-education institutions became charter members
of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS).[1]
The IAAUS was officially established on March 31, 1906, and took its present
name, the NCAA, in 1910.[1]

For several years, the NCAA was a discussion group and rules-making body, but
in 1921, the first NCAA national championship was conducted: the National
Collegiate Track and Field Championships. Gradually, more rules committees
were formed and more championships were created, including a basketball
championship in 1939.[6]

In the late 1940s, there were only two colleges in the country, Notre Dame and
Pennsylvania, with a national TV contract, a considerable source of revenue.
In 1951, the NCAA voted to prohibit any live TV broadcast of college football
games during the season. No sooner had the NCAA voted to ban television than
public outcry forced it to retreat. Instead, the NCAA voted to restrict the
number of televised games for each team to stop the slide in gate attendance.
University of Pennsylvania president Harold Stassen defied the monopoly and
renewed its contract with ABC. Eventually Penn was forced to back down when
the NCAA, refusing Penn's request that the U.S. Attorney General rule on the
legality of the NCAA's restrictive plan,[7][8] threatened to expel the Quakers
from the association. Notre Dame continued televising its games through 1953,
working around the ban by filming its games, then broadcasting them the next
evening.

A series of crises brought the NCAA to a crossroads after World War II. The
"Sanity Code" – adopted to establish guidelines for recruiting and financial
aid – failed to curb abuses. Postseason football games were multiplying with
little control, and member schools were increasingly concerned about how the
new medium of television would affect football attendance.[6]

The complexity of those problems and the growth in membership and
championships demonstrated the need for full-time professional leadership.
Walter Byers, previously a part-time executive assistant, was named executive
director in 1951, and a national headquarters was established in Kansas City,
Missouri in 1952.[6]

Byers wasted no time placing his stamp on the Association. A program to
control live television of football games was approved, the annual Convention
delegated enforcement powers to the Association's Council, and legislation was
adopted governing postseason bowl games.[6]

### 1970s–present[edit]

As college athletics grew, the scope of the nation's athletics programs
diverged, forcing the NCAA to create a structure that recognized varying
levels of emphasis. In 1973, the Association's membership was divided into
three legislative and competitive divisions – I, II, and III.[9] Five years
later in 1978, Division I members voted to create subdivisions I-A and I-AA
(renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship
Subdivision in 2006) in football.[6]

Until the 1980s, the association did not offer women's athletics. Instead, the
Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), with nearly 1000
member schools, governed women's collegiate sports in the United States. The
AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in
the early 1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations
staged women's championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member
schools continued their women's athletics programs under the governance of the
NCAA.[10] By 1982 all divisions of the NCAA offered national championship
events for women's athletics. A year later in 1983, the 75th Convention
approved an expansion to plan women's athletic program services and pushed for
a women's championship program.[6]

By the 1980s, televised college football had become a larger source of income
for the NCAA. In September 1981, the Board of Regents of the University of
Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association filed suit against
the NCAA in district court in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs stated that the NCAA's
football television plan constituted price fixing, output restraints, boycott,
and monopolizing, all of which were illegal under the Sherman Act. The NCAA
argued that its pro-competitive and non-commercial justifications for the plan
– protection of live gate, maintenance of competitive balance among NCAA
member institutions, and the creation of a more attractive "product" to
compete with other forms of entertainment – combined to make the plan
reasonable. In September 1982, the district court found in favor of the
plaintiffs, ruling that the plan violated antitrust laws. It enjoined the
Association from enforcing the contract. The NCAA appealed all the way to the
United States Supreme Court, but lost in 1984 in the 7–2 ruling _NCAA v. Board
of Regents of the University of Oklahoma_.[11] (If the television contracts
the NCAA had with ABC, CBS, and ESPN had remained in effect for the 1984
season, they would have generated some $73.6 million for the Association and
its members.)

In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under
Title IX for systematically giving men in graduate school more waivers than a
woman to participate in college sports. In _National Collegiate Athletic
Association v. Smith_ , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA was not
subject to that law, without reviewing the merits of the discrimination
claim.[12]

Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a
growing trend among NCAA institutions. For example, most German athletes
outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many European athletes,
the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and
athletic career at the same time. Many of these students come to the US with
high academic expectations and aspirations.[13]

In 2009, Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, became the
NCAA's first non-US member institution.[14][15]

In 2014, the NCAA set a record high of a $989 Million in net revenue. Being
just shy of $1 Billion is among the highest of all large sports organizations.

## Headquarters[edit]

The NCAA's current National Office in Indianapolis.

The modern era of the NCAA began in July 1955 when its executive director,
Kansas City, Missouri native Walter Byers, moved the organization's
headquarters from the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago (where its offices were shared
by the headquarters of the Big Ten Conference) to the Fairmount Building at
101 West 11th Street in Downtown Kansas City. The move was intended to
separate the NCAA from the direct influence of any individual conference and
to keep it centrally located.

The Fairmount was a block from Municipal Auditorium which had hosted Final
Four games in 1940, 1941, and 1942. After Byers moved to Kansas City, the
championships would be held in Municipal in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1961, and
1964.

The Fairmount office consisted of three rooms with no air conditioning. Byers'
staff consisted of four people: an assistant, two secretaries, and a
bookkeeper.[16]

In 1964, it moved three blocks away to offices in the Midland Theatre. In
1973, it moved to 6299 Nall at Shawnee Mission Parkway in suburban Mission,
Kansas in a $1.2 million building on 3.4 acres (14,000 m2). In 1989, it moved
6 miles (9.7 km) farther south to 6201 College Boulevard in Overland Park,
Kansas. The new building was on 11.35 acres (45,900 m2) and had 130,000 square
feet (12,000 m2) of space.[17]

The NCAA was dissatisfied with its Johnson County, Kansas suburban location
noting that its location on the south edges of the Kansas City suburbs was
more than 40 minutes from Kansas City International Airport. They also noted
that the suburban location was not drawing visitors to its new visitors'
center.[18]

In 1997, it asked for bids for a new headquarters. Various cities competed for
a new headquarters with the two finalists being Kansas City and Indianapolis.
Kansas City proposed to relocate the NCAA back downtown near the Crown Center
complex and would locate the visitors' center in Union Station. However Kansas
City's main sports venue Kemper Arena was nearly 30 years old.[18]
Indianapolis argued that it was in fact more central than Kansas City in that
two-thirds of the members are east of the Mississippi River.[18] The
50,000-seat RCA Dome far eclipsed the 17,000-seat Kemper Arena. In 1999, the
NCAA moved its 300-member staff to its new headquarters in the White River
State Park in a four-story 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m2) facility on the
west edge of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. Adjacent to the headquarters is
the 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) NCAA Hall of Champions.[19]

## Structure[edit]

The NCAA's Board of Governors (formerly known as the Executive Committee) is
the main body within the NCAA. This body elects the NCAA's President.[20]

The NCAA's legislative structure is broken down into cabinets and committees,
consisting of various representatives of its member schools.[ _citation
needed_ ] These may be broken down further into sub-committees. The
legislation is then passed on, which oversees all the cabinets and committees,
and also includes representatives from the schools, such as athletic directors
and faculty advisors. Management Council legislation goes on to the Board of
Directors, which consists of school presidents, for final approval. The NCAA
staff provides support, acting as guides, liaisons, researchers, and public
and media relations.

The NCAA runs the officiating software company ArbiterSports, based in Sandy,
Utah, a joint venture between two subsidiaries of the NCAA, Arbiter LLC and
eOfficials LLC. The NCAA's stated objective for the venture is to help improve
the fairness, quality, and consistency of officiating across amateur
athletics.[21][22]

### Presidents of the NCAA[edit]

The NCAA had no full-time administrator until 1951, when Walter Byers was
appointed executive director.[1] In 1988, the title was changed to
President.[23]

## Player eligibility[edit]

To participate in college athletics in their freshman year, the NCAA requires
that students meet three criteria: having graduated from high school, be
completing the minimum required academic courses, and having qualifying grade-
point average (GPA) and SAT or ACT scores.[26]

The 16 academic credits are four courses in English, two courses in math, two
classes in social science, two in natural or physical science, and one
additional course in English, math, natural or physical science, or another
academic course such as a foreign language.[27]

To meet the requirements for grade point average and SAT scores, the lowest
possible GPA a student may be eligible with is a 1.70, as long as they have an
SAT score of 1400. The lowest SAT scores a student may be eligible with is 700
as long as they have a GPA of 2.500.[26]

As of 2011, a high school student may sign a letter of intent to enter and
play football for a college only after the first Wednesday in February.[28] In
August 2011, the NCAA announced plans to raise academic requirements for
postseason competition, including its two most prominent competitions,
football's now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (replaced in 2014 by the
College Football Playoff) and the Men's Division I Basketball Championship;
the new requirement, which are based on an "Academic Progress Rate" (APR) that
measures retention and graduation rates, and is calculated on a four-year,
rolling basis.[29] The changes raise the rate from 900 to 930, which
represents a 50% graduation rate.[29]

Students are generally allowed to compete athletically for four years.
Athletes are allowed to sit out a year while still attending school but not
lose a year of eligibility by redshirting.

## NCAA sponsored sports[edit]

The NCAA currently awards 90 national championships yearly – 46 women's, 41
men's, and coed championships for fencing, rifle, and skiing. Sports
sanctioned by the NCAA include the following: basketball, baseball (men),
beach volleyball (women), softball (women), football (men), cross country,
field hockey (women), bowling (women), golf, fencing (coeducational),
lacrosse, soccer, gymnastics, rowing (women only), volleyball, ice hockey,
water polo, rifle (coeducational), tennis, skiing (coeducational), track and
field, swimming and diving, and wrestling (men). The newest sport to be
officially sanctioned is beach volleyball, which held its first championship
in the 2015–16 school year.

The Football Bowl Subdivision of Division I determines its own champion
separately from the NCAA via the "College Football Playoff"; this is not an
official NCAA championship (see below). The most recently added championship
is a single all-divisions championship in women's beach volleyball, which was
approved by leaders of all three divisions in late 2014 and early 2015. The
first championship was held in spring 2016.[30] The NCAA had called the sport
"sand volleyball" until June 23, 2015, when it announced that it would use the
internationally recognized name of "beach volleyball".[31]

### Women's "emerging sports"[edit]

In addition to the above sports, the NCAA recognizes "emerging sports" for
women. These sports have scholarship limitations for each sport, but do not
currently have officially sanctioned NCAA championships. A member institution
may use these sports to meet the required level of sports sponsorship for its
division. An "Emerging Sport" must gain championship status (minimum 40
varsity programs for team sports, except 28 for Division III) within 10 years,
or show steady progress toward that goal to remain on the list.[33] Until
then, it is under the auspices of the NCAA and its respective institutions.
Emerging Sport status allows for competition to include club teams to satisfy
the minimum number of competitions bylaw established by the NCAA.

The three sports currently designated as women's "emerging sports" are:

  * Rugby
  * Triathlon
  * Equestrian*

Equestrian has been recommended for elimination as an "emerging sport" due to
lack of growth in the number of participating institutions.[34]

## Sports added and dropped[edit]

The popularity of each of these sports programs has changed over time. Between
1988–89 and 2010–11, NCAA schools had net additions of 510 men's teams and
2,703 women's teams.[35]

The following tables show the changes over time in the number of NCAA schools
across all three divisions combined sponsoring each of the men's and women's
team sports.

### Men's sports[edit]

The men's sports with the biggest net gains during the 1988/89 to 2010/11
period were indoor track and field, lacrosse, and cross-country running (each
with more than 100 net gains). The men's sports with the biggest losses were
wrestling (–104 teams), tennis, and rifle; the men's team sport with the most
net losses was water polo.[35] Other reports show that 355 college wrestling
programs have been eliminated since 2000; 212 men's gymnastics programs have
been eliminated since 1969 with only 17 programs remaining as of 2013.[36]

### Women's sports[edit]

The women's sports with the biggest net gains during the 1988–89 to 2010–11
period were soccer (+599 teams), golf, and indoor track and field; no women's
sports programs experienced double-digit net losses.[35]

### Trophies[edit]

For every NCAA sanctioned sport other than Division I FBS football, the NCAA
awards trophies with gold, silver, and bronze plating for the first, second,
and third place teams respectively.[ _citation needed_ ] In the case of the
NCAA basketball tournaments, both semifinalists who did not make the
championship game receive bronze plated trophies for third place (prior to
1982 the teams played a "consolation" game to determine third place).[
_citation needed_ ] Similar trophies are awarded to both semifinalists in the
NCAA football tournaments (which are conducted in Division I FCS and both
lower divisions), which have never had a third-place game. Winning teams
maintain permanent possession of these trophies unless it is later found that
they were won via serious rules violations.

Starting with the 2001–02 season, and again in the 2007–08 season, the
trophies were changed.[ _citation needed_ ] Starting in the 2006 basketball
season, teams that make the Final Four in the Division I tournament receive
bronze plated "regional championship" trophies upon winning their Regional
Championship. The teams that make the National Championship game receive an
additional trophy that is gold-plated for the winner and silver-plated for the
runner-up. Starting in the mid-1990s, the National Champions in men's and
women's basketball receive an elaborate trophy with a black marble base and
crystal "neck" with a removable crystal basketball following the presentation
of the standard NCAA Championship trophy.

As of December 20, 2016,[45] UCLA, Stanford, and Southern California (USC)
have the most NCAA championships. UCLA holds the most, winning a combined 113
NCAA team championships in men's and women's sports, while Stanford is second
with 112 and USC is third with 103.

### Football Bowl Subdivision[edit]

Main articles: College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS
and College Football Playoff

The NCAA has never sanctioned an official championship for its highest level
of football, now known as Division I FBS. Instead, several outside bodies
award their own titles. The NCAA does not hold a championship tournament or
game for Division I FBS football. In the past, teams that placed first in any
of a number of season-ending media polls, most notable the AP Poll of writers
and the Coaches Poll, were said to have won the "national championship".

Starting in 2014, the College Football Playoff – a consortium of the
conferences and independent schools that compete in Division I FBS and six
bowl games – has arranged to place the top four teams (based on a thirteen-
member committee that selects and seeds the teams) into two semifinal games,
with the winners advancing to compete in the College Football Playoff National
Championship, which is not officially sanctioned or recognized by the NCAA.
The winner of the game receives a trophy; since the NCAA awards no national
championship for Division I FBS football, this trophy does not denote _NCAA_
as other NCAA college sports national championship trophies do.

## Media[edit]

The NCAA has current media rights contracts with CBS Sports, CBS Sports
Network, ESPN, ESPN Plus, and Turner Sports for coverage of its 88
championships. According to the official NCAA website,[46] ESPN and its
associated networks have rights to 21 championships, CBS to 67, and Turner
Sports to one. The followings are the most prominent championships and
rightsholders:

  * CBS: Men's basketball (NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, with Turner Sports, and NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament), track and field, ice hockey (women's division I)
  * ESPN: Women's basketball (all divisions), baseball, softball, ice hockey (men's Division I), football (all divisions including Div. I FCS), soccer (Division I for both sexes)
  * Turner Sports: NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament with CBS

WestwoodOne has exclusive radio rights to the men's and women's basketball
Final Fours to the men's College World Series (baseball). DirecTV has an
exclusive package expanding CBS' coverage of the men's basketball tournament.

From 1998 to 2013, Electronic Arts had a license to develop college sports
video games with the NCAA's branding, which included its _NCAA Football_ and
_NCAA Basketball_ (formerly _NCAA March Madness_ ) series. The NCAA's
licensing was not required to produce the games, as rights to use teams are
not licensed through the NCAA, but through entities such as individual schools
and the Collegiate Licensing Company. EA only acquired the license so that it
could officially incorporate the Men's Division I Basketball Championship into
its college basketball game series. The NCAA withdrew EA's license due to
uncertainties surrounding a series of lawsuits, most notably _O'Bannon v.
NCAA_ , involving the use of player likenesses in college sports video
games.[47][48]

## LGBT inclusion policy[edit]

In 2010, the NCAA Executive Committee announced its support and commitment to
diversity, inclusion, and gender equality among its student-athletes, coaches,
and administrators. The statement included the NCAA’s commitment to ensuring
that all students have equal opportunities to achieve their academic goals,
and coaches and administrators have equal opportunities for career development
in a climate of respect.[49] In 2012, the LGBTQ Subcommittee of the NCAA
association-wide Committee on Women’s Athletics and the Minority Opportunities
and Interests Committee commissioned _Champions of Respect,_ a document that
provides resources and advocacy that promotes inclusion and equality for LGBTQ
student-athletes, coaches, administrators and all others associated with
intercollegiate athletics _._ This resource uses guides from the Women's
Sports Foundation It Takes a Team! project for addressing issues related to
LGBTQ equality in intercollegiate athletics.[49] The document provides
information on specific issues LGBTQ sportspeople face, similarities and
differences of these issues on women’s and men’s teams, policy recommendations
and best practices, and legal resources and court cases.[50]

The NCAA has kept these core values central to its decisions regarding the
allocation of championship bids. In April 2016, the Board of Governors
announced new requirements for host cities that includes protection against
discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for all people
involved in the event. This decision was prompted by several states passing
laws that permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity
in accordance with religious beliefs.[51]

The NCAA expressed concern over Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act
that allows businesses to discriminate against people based on their sexual
orientation. This bill was proposed just before Indianapolis was set to host
the 2015 Men’s Basketball Final Four tournament.[52] The bill clashed with the
NCAA core values of inclusion and equality, and forced the NCAA to consider
moving events out of Indiana. Under pressure from across the nation and
fearing the economic loss of being banned from hosting NCAA events, the
governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, revised the bill so that businesses could not
discriminate based on sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. The
NCAA accepted the revised bill and continues to host events in Indiana.[53]
The bill was enacted into law on July 1, 2015.[54]

On September 12, 2016, the NCAA announced that it would pull all seven planned
championship events out of North Carolina for the 2016-2017 academic year.[55]
This decision was a response to the state passing the Public Facilities
Privacy and Security Act (H.B. 2) on March 23, 2016. This law requires people
to use public restrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth and
stops cities from passing laws that protect against discrimination towards gay
and transgender people.[56] The NCAA Board of Governors determined that this
law would make ensuring an inclusive atmosphere in the host communities
challenging, and relocating these championship events best reflects the
association's commitment to maintaining an environment that is consistent with
its core values.[55] North Carolina has lost the opportunity to host the 2018
Final Four Tournament which was scheduled to be in Charlotte, but is relocated
to San Antonio. If H.B. 2 is not repealed, North Carolina could be barred from
bidding for events from 2019 to 2022.[57]

Historically, the NCAA has used its authority in deciding on host cities to
promote its core values. The Association also prohibits championship events in
states that display the Confederate flag, and at member schools that have
abusive or offensive nicknames or mascots based on Native American imagery.
Board members wish to ensure that anyone associated with an NCAA championship
event will be treated with fairness and respect.[51]

## Rules violations[edit]

See also: List of NCAA institutions on probation

Member schools pledge to follow the rules promulgated by the NCAA. Creation of
a mechanism to enforce the NCAA's legislation occurred in 1952 after careful
consideration by the membership.

Allegations of rules violations are referred to the NCAA's investigative
staff. A preliminary investigation is initiated to determine if an official
inquiry is warranted and to categorize any resultant violations as secondary
or major. If several violations are found, the NCAA may determine that the
school as a whole has exhibited a "lack of institutional control." The
institution involved is notified promptly and may appear in its own behalf
before the NCAA Committee on Infractions.

Findings of the Committee on Infractions and the resultant sanctions in major
cases are reported to the institution. Sanctions will generally include having
the institution placed on "probation" for a period of time, in addition to
other penalties. The institution may appeal the findings or sanctions to an
appeals committee. After considering written reports and oral presentations by
representatives of the Committee on Infractions and the institution, the
committee acts on the appeal. Action may include accepting the infractions
committee's findings and penalty, altering either, or making its own findings
and imposing an appropriate penalty.

In cases of particularly egregious misconduct, the NCAA has the power to ban a
school from participating in a particular sport, a penalty is known as the
"Death Penalty". Since 1985, any school that commits major violations during
the probationary period can be banned from the sport involved for up to two
years. However, when the NCAA opts not to issue a death penalty for a repeat
violation, it must explain why it did not do so. This penalty has only been
imposed three times in its modern form, most notably when Southern Methodist
University's football team had its 1987 season canceled due to massive rules
violations dating back more than a decade. SMU opted not to field a team in
1988 as well due to the aftershocks from the sanctions, and the program has
never recovered; it has only four winning seasons and four bowl appearance
since then (mostly under June Jones, the team's head coach from 2008 until his
resignation during the 2014 season). The devastating effect the death penalty
had on SMU has reportedly made the NCAA skittish about issuing another one.
Since the SMU case, there are only three instances where the NCAA has
seriously considered imposing it against a Division I school; it imposed it
against Division II Morehouse College's men's soccer team in 2003 and Division
III MacMurray College's men's tennis team in 2005. In addition to these cases,
the most recent division I school to be considered was Penn State. This
because of the Jerry Sandusky Incident that consequently almost landed Penn
State on the hook for the Death Penalty. They received a 60 million dollars
fine, in addition to forfeited seasons and other sanctions as well.

Additionally, in particularly egregious cases of rules violations, coaches,
athletic directors, and athletic support staff can be barred from working for
any NCAA member school without permission from the NCAA. This procedure is
known as a "show-cause penalty" (not to be confused with an order to show
cause in the legal sense).[58] Theoretically, a school can hire someone with a
"show cause" on their record during the time the show cause order is in effect
only with permission from the NCAA Infractions Committee. The school assumes
the risks and stigma of hiring such a person. It may then end up being
sanctioned by the NCAA and the Infractions Committee for their choice,
possibly losing athletic scholarships, revenue from schools who would not want
to compete with that other school, and the ability for their games to be
televised, along with restrictions on recruitment and practicing times. As a
result, a show-cause order essentially has the effect of blackballing
individuals from being hired for the duration of the order.

## Finances[edit]

As of 2014 the NCAA reported that it had over $600 million in unrestricted net
assets in its annual report.[60] Due to its tax exempt status as a non-for-
profit[61] the NCAA is not required to pay most taxes on in income that larger
corporations are subject to. While this business model has been challenged
during court cases, the NCAA has ultimately emerged victorious.[62] During
2014 the NCAA also reported almost a billion dollars of revenue, contributing
to a "budget surplus" of over $80 million.[60] Due to its status as a non-for-
profit additional money earned that is unspent is "budget surplus" instead of
"profit". It received over $700 million during that same year from licensing
TV rights to its sporting events.[60] Along with income generated from its
sporting events, the NCAA also earns money through its endowment fund.
Established in 2004 with $45 million, the fund has grown to over $380 million
in 2014.[63]

## Player compensation Controversy[edit]

The NCAA limits the amount of compensation that players can receive. This rule
has generated controversy, in light of the large amounts of revenues that
schools earn from sports from TV contracts, ticket sales, and licensing and
merchandise. Several commentators have discussed whether the NCAA limit on
player compensation violates antitrust laws.

  * After losing the 1953 case _The University of Denver v. Nemeth_ , where it was found that a student and athlete was owed workers' compensation, it has been argued[ _by whom?_ ] that the NCAA created the term "student-athlete." Andrew Zimbalist, in his book _Unpaid Professionals_ (1999), claims the term was invented to prevent similar future litigation losses.
  * In 2007, the case of _White et al. v. NCAA_ was brought by former NCAA student-athletes Jason White, Brian Pollack, Jovan Harris, and Chris Craig as a class action lawsuit. They argued that the NCAA's current limits on a full scholarship or Grant in Aid was a violation of federal antitrust laws. Their reasoning was that in the absence of such a limit, NCAA member schools would be free to offer any financial aid packages they desired to recruit the student and athlete. The NCAA settled before a ruling by the court, by agreeing to set up the Former Student-Athlete Fund to "assist qualified candidates applying for receipt of career development expenses and/or reimbursement of educational expenses under the terms of the agreement with plaintiffs in a federal antitrust lawsuit."[64]
  * In 2013, Jay Bilas revealed that the NCAA was taking advantage of individual players through jersey sales in its store. Specifically, he typed the names of several top college football players, among them Tajh Boyd, Teddy Bridgewater, Jadeveon Clowney, Johnny Manziel, and AJ McCarron, into the search engine of the NCAA's official online store, and received the players' jerseys as primary search results.[65] The NCAA took down player jersey sales immediately following the incident.[66]
  * Former NCAA President Walter Byers, in his book _Unsportsmanlike Conduct: Exploiting College Athletes_ , summarizes his criticisms of the NCAA's operation by stating that "Today the NCAA Presidents Commission is . . . firmly committed to the neo-plantation belief that the enormous proceeds from college games belong to the overseers (administrators) and supervisors (coaches). The plantation workers performing in the arena may only receive those benefits authorized by the overseers."
  * The National Collegiate Players Association (NCPA) is a group started by former UCLA football players with the purpose of organizing student-athletes. Their goal is to change NCAA rules they view as unjust. Two of the rules they focus on include raising the scholarship amount and holding schools responsible for their players' sports-related medical injuries.[67]
  * In March 2014, four players filed a class action antitrust lawsuit, alleging that the NCAA and its five dominant conferences are an "unlawful cartel". The suit charges that NCAA caps on the value of athletic scholarships have "illegally restricted the earning power of football and men's basketball players while making billions off their labor".[68] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman called the suit "an instantly credible threat to the NCAA."[69] On September 30, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that limiting compensation to the cost of an athlete's attendance at a university was sufficient. It simultaneously ruled against a federal judge's proposal to pay student athletes $5,000 per year in deferred compensation.[62]
  * Northwestern University's Division One Football team was the first NCAA team to unionize in 2014.[70]
  * South Park, in the episode "Crack Baby Athletic Association" (s15e05), made oblique reference to the NCAA and compared its rules to slavery.[71]

Numerous criticisms have been lodged against the NCAA. These include, but are
not limited to:

  * In 1998, the NCAA settled a lawsuit from former UNLV basketball coach, Jerry Tarkanian, for $2.5 million. Tarkanian sued the NCAA after he was forced to resign from UNLV in 1992. The suit claimed the agency singled him out while he was at UNLV from 1973 to 1992. During that time, the university was penalized three different times by the NCAA. Tarkanian said "They can never, ever, make up for all the pain and agony they caused me. All I can say is that for 25 years they beat the hell out of me". The NCAA said that it regretted the long battle and it now has more understanding of Tarkanian's position and that the case has changed the enforcement process for the better. In the 1970s a Nevada judge stated that the NCAA's evidence against Tarkanian was "total 100 percent hearsay without a scrap of documentation in substantiation. The evidence shows that every fundamental principle pertaining to the plaintiff's due process rights was violated".[72] Don Yaeger wrote "Public records suggest (Tarkanian's) case was the worst investigation ever conducted by the NCAA, rife with intimidation of athletes, bigotry ... slipshod work, creative note-taking and untruth by an investigator and vindictiveness by a disgruntled former coach".[73]
  * In 1977, prompted partly by the Tarkanian case, the US Congress initiated an investigation into the NCAA.[72] It, combined with Tarkanian's case, forced the NCAA's internal files into the public record.[74]
  * In 2013, the NCAA was criticized for denying Georgia offensive lineman Kolton Houston his eligibility for violating the drug policy. Houston tested positive for the anabolic steroid norandrolone that was given without his knowledge to recover from shoulder surgery during high school, but the banned substance remain trapped in the fatty tissues in his body. Despite a huge decline in the substance level to the point where Houston does not gain a significant advantage for using the drug and proof that he had not been reusing it, he remained ineligible. Houston would then undergo dangerous operational procedures to get under the threshold to regain his eligibility, which goes against the mission for the NCAA to help out students. The NCAA is being heavily criticized for maintaining their rigid standards and not making an exception for Houston.[75]
