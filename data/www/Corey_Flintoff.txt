Corey Flintoff (born April 8, 1946) is an international correspondent based in Moscow for National Public Radio.
Flintoff was born in Fairbanks, Alaska. He has a bachelor's degree from University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree from University of Chicago. Flintoff spent many years as a newscaster and reporter at the Alaska Public Radio Network before joining NPR in 1990, where he was a newscaster.
In 2007, Flintoff was included in a report compiled by MSNBC of journalists who had made campaign contributions to political candidates. A 2003 contribution of $538 to Howard Dean made their list. Flintoff insists that his wife made the contribution from a joint account. In spite of the error, Flintoff stated that it led to policy reforms at NPR.
