The following list shows the number of Olympic medals won by alumni or students of American universities - not necessarily representing the U.S. - in Olympic Games up through 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. The list starts with universities with most Olympic medals, continuing in descending order. Only those who actually received Olympic medals are counted - thus the list includes Olympic athletes only, excluding coaches, staff managers and so on. A university with remarks "I" means the count might be incomplete due to the lack of reliable sources.
In 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, the university with most Olympic medals in the U.S. is Stanford University (27 medals), followed by UC Berkeley (22 medals) and University of Southern California (21 medals); University of Florida (13 medals) and UT Austin (13 medals) tied for 4th place.
