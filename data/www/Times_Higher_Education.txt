## Publication history[edit]

From its first issue, in 1971, until 2008, _The Times Higher Education
Supplement_ ( _THES_ ) was published in newspaper format and was born out of,
and affiliated with, _The Times_ newspaper. On 10 January 2008, it was
relaunched as a magazine. It is published by TES Global, which until October
2005 was a division of Rupert Murdoch's News International. The magazine is
edited by John Gill. Phil Baty is the editor at large, and is responsible for
international coverage. He is also the editor of the magazine's World
University Rankings.

The magazine features a fictional satirical column written by Laurie Taylor,
the "Poppletonian", which reflects on life at the fictional Poppleton
University.[2]

In 2011 _Times Higher Education_ was awarded the titles of "Weekly Business
Magazine of the Year" and "Media Business Brand of the Year" by the
Professional Publishers Association.[3]

## _Times Higher Education_ World University Rankings [edit]

Main article: Times Higher Education World University Rankings

_Times Higher Education_ became known for publishing the annual _Times Higher
Education–QS World University Rankings_ , which first appeared in November
2004. On 30 October 2009 _Times Higher Education_ broke with QS, then its
partner in compiling the Rankings, and signed an agreement with Thomson
Reuters to provide the data instead. The magazine developed a new methodology
in consultation with its readers and its editorial board. Thomson Reuters
collects and analyses the data used to produce the rankings on behalf of
_Times Higher Education_. The results have been published annually since
autumn 2010. QS, which collected and analysed the rankings data from 2004 to
2009, no longer has any involvement with _Times Higher Education'_ s World
University Rankings.[4][5]

## Awards[edit]

The magazine runs two sets of awards annually.

The first is the " _Times Higher Education_ Awards". The 2011 awards took
place on 24 November at the Grosvenor House Hotel on London's Park Lane and
received a record number of entries across the 18 categories.[6] Seventeen
universities were given awards in different categories, with the University of
Sheffield being "University of the Year". Tessa Blackstone was given the "Lord
Dearing Lifetime Achievement Award".[6]

The University of Strathclyde was named as the University of the Year at the
2012 awards which took place on 29 November 2012 at the Grosvenor House Hotel
on London's Park Lane. University of Strathclyde Principal and Vice-Chancellor
Professor Sir Jim McDonald received the award at the ceremony.[7][8]

The " _Times Higher Education_ Leadership and Management Awards" (Thelmas)
were launched in 2009. The Thelmas were set up to recognise the impact that
administrative staff have on the success of higher education institutions.
