Southbound is a compilation record by Hour Glass, featuring outtakes from each of the group's two albums for Liberty Records, Hour Glass (1967) and Power of Love (1968) as well as material recorded by Gregg Allman in 1968 and 1969 with session musicians in order to prevent Liberty Records from suing the group due to their disbanding. All of the material has been previously released on the 1992 EMI reissues of Hour Glass and Power of Love, both now out of print.
