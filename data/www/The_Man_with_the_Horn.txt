The Man with the Horn is an album released by Miles Davis in 1981, featuring drummer Al Foster, saxophonist Bill Evans, guitarists Mike Stern and Barry Finnerty, and others. It was Davis's first new release since 1975, following a six-year reclusive retirement.
Rock-oriented in nature, the music fuses 1980s pop with improvisational funk and fusion styles. The album marked Davis's return to his more traditional trumpet playing, although the title song "The Man with the Horn" features wah-wah improvisation along with vocals.
