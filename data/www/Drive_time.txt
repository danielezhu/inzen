In radio broadcasting, drive time refers to dayparts in which radio broadcasters attempt to reach the large number of people who listen to their car radios while driving to and from work. The drivetime periods are when the number of radio listeners is at its peak and, thus, commercial radio can get paid the most for advertising. Drive times coincide with rush hours.
