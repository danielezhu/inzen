The City of Greater New York was the term used by many politicians and scholars for the expanded City of New York created on January 1, 1898 by consolidating the existing City of New York with the East Bronx, Brooklyn, western Queens County, and Staten Island.
The section of the Bronx west of the Bronx River had been annexed to the City and County of New York in 1874, and was known as the Annexed District. In the years leading up to consolidation, the City of Brooklyn had expanded by annexing all of the other towns and cities in Kings County. Only the western part of Queens County was part of the consolidation plan. In 1899, its three eastern towns separated to form the new Nassau County.
