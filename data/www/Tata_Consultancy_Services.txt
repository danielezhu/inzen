## History[edit]

### 1968-2000[edit]

TCS Limited was founded in 1968 by a division of Tata Sons Limited.[15] Its
early contracts included punched card services to sister company TISCO (now
Tata Steel), working on an Inter-Branch Reconciliation System for the Central
Bank of India,[16] and providing bureau services to Unit Trust of India.

In 1975, TCS delivered an electronic depository and trading system called
SECOM for the Swiss company SIS SegaInterSettle (deutsch); it also developed
System X for the Canadian Depository System and automated the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange.[17] It associated with a Swiss partner, TKS Teknosoft, which
it later acquired.[18]

In 1980, TCS established India's first dedicated software research and
development centre, the Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC) in
Pune.[19] In 1981, it established India's first client-dedicated offshore
development centre, set up for clients Tandem. TCS later (1993) partnered with
Canada-based software factory Integrity Software Corp, which TCS later
acquired.

In anticipation of the Y2K bug and the launch of a unified European currency
(Euro), Tata Consultancy Services created the factory model for Y2K conversion
and developed software tools which automated the conversion process and
enabled third-party developer and client implementation.[20]

### 2000 to present[edit]

On 25 August 2004, TCS became a Publicly Listed Company.[21]

In 2005, TCS became the first India-based IT services company to enter the
bioinformatics market.[22] In 2006, it designed an ERP system for the Indian
Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation.[23] By 2008, its e-business
activities were generating over US$500 million in annual revenues.[24][25]

TCS entered the small and medium enterprises market for the first time in
2011, with cloud-based offerings.[26] On the last trading day of 2011, it
overtook RIL to achieve the highest market capitalisation of any India-based
company.[27] In the 2011/12 fiscal year, TCS achieved annual revenues of over
US$10 billion for the first time.[28]

In May 2013, TCS was awarded a six-year contract worth over ₹ 1100 crores to
provide services to the Indian Department of Posts.[29] In 2013, the firm
moved from the 13th position to 10th position in the _League of top 10 global
IT services companies_[30] and in July 2014, it became the first Indian
company with over Rs 5 lakh crore market capitalization.[31][32]

In Jan 2015, TCS ends RIL's 23-year run as most profitable firm[33]

In Jan 2017, the company announced a partnership with Aurus, Inc., a payments
technology company, to deliver payment solutions for retailers using TCS
OmniStore, a first of its kind unified store commerce platform.[34]

and optimization tools)[87] a Model Driven Development software that can
automatically create code based on a model of a software, and rewrite the code
based on the user's needs.[88] Research at TRDDC has also resulted in the
development of Sujal, a low-cost water purifier that can be manufactured using

##  Controversies[edit]

### Class action lawsuit[edit]

On 14 February 2006, U.S. law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP
filed a nationwide class action lawsuit against Tata.[113] In July 2013, judge
Claudia Wilken of the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California in
Oakland, California, granted final approval to the settlement of the lawsuit
on behalf of all non-U.S. citizens employed by TCS within the state of
California from 14 February 2002 to 30 June 2005. The workers claimed that
they were forced to sign over their federal and state tax refunds to their
employer, as well as stating their Indian salaries were wrongfully deducted
from their U.S. pay.[114] On 22 February 2013, the Company entered into an
agreement to settle for a sum of INR 16,163 lakhs ($29.75 million), this class
action suit filed in a United States Court relating to payment to employees on
deputation.[63]

Charleston County in South Carolina sued Tata Consultancy Services for
delivering botched software. TCS won the contract to create an online tax
system (digiTax) for a $1.2 million. The system was supposed to go live in
July 2004 but was plagued by several delays. Tata developed the software at
its offshore development center in Chennai, India. The software was rejected
by Charleston County during user acceptance testing where it failed to meet
even the basic requirements. County sued Tata and it agreed to pay back $1
million in out of court settlement. Charleston County finally bought an off
the shelf solution.[115]

A US grand jury has slapped two companies of India's Tata group - Tata
Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp - with a USD 940
million fine in a trade secret lawsuit filed against them. Epic Systems had
accused TCS and Tata America International Corp, in a lawsuit filed in
October, 2014 in US District Court in Madison which was amended in January and
December 2015, of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential
information, documents and data" belonging to Epic.[116]

### Accusations of discrimination[edit]

In May 2013, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in its extensive
coverage of the hiring of temporary foreign workers in Canada and the
unemployment issues faced by Canadians, reported that TCS rarely hires skilled
experienced Canadians at the Toronto offices while advertising open positions
in Canada. TCS responded that the company hired more than 125 Canadian workers
in 2013 who make less than 1.2% of the 10,452 workers the company has outside
of India.[63][117]

In April 2015, a class-action lawsuit against TCS was filed in a San Francisco
federal court by a U.S. information technology worker and ex-employee, who
accused the company of discriminating against American workers by favoring
South Asians in hiring and promotion. The lawsuit claimed that South Asians
comprise 95% of the company's 14,000-person U.S. workforce, and that TCS
engaged in discriminatory practices by sourcing most of its workforce through
the H-1B visa programme, by focusing its U.S.-based hiring disproportionately
on South Asians and by favoring South Asian employees in its human resources
practices. In response, TCS refuted the plaintiff's claims, assuring that it
is an equal opportunity employer and bases its employment practices on non-
discriminatory reasons. A spokesperson said that in 2014 alone the company had
recruited over 2,600 U.S. hires.[118]
