Yahoo Mail, a web-based email service, launched in 1997 through the American parent company Yahoo. Yahoo Mail provides four different email plans: three are for personal use (Basic, Plus, and Ad Free) and another is paid-for business use.  By December 2011, it had 281 million users, making it the third largest web-based email service in the world.
As many as three web interfaces were available at any given date. The traditional "Yahoo! Mail Classic" preserved the availability of their original 1997 interface until July 2013 in North America. A 2005 version included a new Ajax interface, drag-and-drop, improved search, keyboard shortcuts, address auto-completion, and tabs. However, other features were removed, such as column widths and one click delete-move-to-next. In October 2010, Yahoo! released a beta version of Yahoo! Mail, which included improvements to performance, search, and Facebook integration. In May 2011, it became the default interface. Their current Webmail interface was introduced in 2012.
On December 14, 2016, Yahoo announced more than 1 billion user accounts were hacked in a breach that occurred back in 2013. Earlier that year in September, Yahoo! announced that an additional 500 million user accounts were breached in 2014. The company was said to have discovered about the breach that affected hundreds of millions of accounts years before their initial announcement.
