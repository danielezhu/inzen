No Depression is a quarterly roots music journal with a concurrent online publication at nodepression.com.
In print, No Depression is a ~150-page ad-free publication focused on longform music reporting and deep analysis that ties contemporary artists with the long chain of American roots music. Its content is exclusive to print and its contributors include popular roots music artists as well as professional critics and reporters, photographers, illustrators, and fine artists.
No Depression online is largely crowd-sourced by professional writers and roots music fans alike, and it also employs a handful of regular columnists and staff reviewers.
Since 1995, No Depression has helped to preserve and define the evolution of American roots music and all its forms: alt-country, Americana, folk, bluegrass, blues, and roots-rock and roll.
