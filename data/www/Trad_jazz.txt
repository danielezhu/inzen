Trad jazz, short for "traditional jazz", refers to the Dixieland and ragtime jazz styles of the early 20th century, which typically used a front line of trumpet, clarinet and trombone in contrast to more modern styles which usually include saxophones, and the revival of these styles in mid 20th-century Britain before the emergence of beat music.
