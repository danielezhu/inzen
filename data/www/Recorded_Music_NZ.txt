Recorded Music NZ (formerly Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ)) is a non-profit trade association of record producers, distributors and recording artists who sell music in New Zealand. Membership of Recorded Music NZ is open to any record label operating in New Zealand, and is dominated by the American and UK owned "Big Three" (Sony, Universal and Warner Music Group). Recorded Music NZ has approximately 56 affiliate members.
Prior to June 2013, the association was known as the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). RIANZ and PPNZ Music Licensing were merged and renamed Recorded Music NZ.
Recorded Music NZ offers services under three areas: Member Services (the New Zealand Music Awards, the Official NZ Top40 Chart and direct services to artists and labels), Music Licensing (carried out through PPNZ Music Licensing) and Pro Music services regarding copyright protection and corporate affairs.
