Apache Ain't Shit is the only album released by rapper Apache. It was released in 1993 on Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. Records and featured production from The 45 King, Large Professor, and Diamond D. The album peaked at number 66 on the Billboard 200 and number 15 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. One charting single was released from the album, the A Tribe Called Quest-produced hit "Gangsta Bitch," which made it to No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 49 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and No. 11 on the Hot Rap Singles. Another single titled "Do Fa Self" was also released, but it did not chart. The album is now out of print.
While noting that the lyrics may have been humor not intended to be taken seriously, Allmusic still criticized the albums racist anti-white themes, such as those in the song "Kill D'White People."
