The Academy Award for Best Sound Editing is an Academy Award granted yearly to a film exhibiting the finest or most aesthetic sound design or sound editing. Sound editing is the creation of sound effects (such as foley). The award is usually received by the Supervising Sound Editors of the film, perhaps accompanied by the Sound Designers.
The sound branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), until 2006 would use a "bake-off" of the best films from the previous year to decide which films should be referred to the full Academy as nominations for the award. In a rule change on June 30, 2006, the bake-off for the Sound Branch was eliminated, and the usual process of a "preferential ballot" submission was instituted.
During certain years, the highest award given for this category may be a "Special Achievement Award", not an Oscar. Academy rules require that a minimum number of films must be nominated in a category for an Academy Award to be granted; when the number of qualifying nominees is insufficient, a Special Achievement Award is granted instead.
This is a list of films that have won or been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Effects (1963–67, 1975), Sound Effects Editing (1977, 1981–99), or Sound Editing (1979, 2000–present). See Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing for a corresponding list of winners for Best Sound.
