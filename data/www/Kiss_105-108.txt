Kiss 105-108 is East Anglia's radio station, playing dance music and R'n'B across Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and North Essex. It has been known as Vibe 105-108, Vibe FM and briefly Non-Stop Vibe which ran successfully from 22 November 1997 until relaunch on 6 September 2006 as part of the Kiss network, alongside sister stations Vibe 101 in Bristol (which became Kiss 101 on the same date) and Kiss 100, London.
All three Kiss stations started to carry the new Kiss logo, and the core music genre followed Kiss 100's more urban bias (the Vibe music brand was much more dance oriented). Kiss 105-108 and Kiss 101 retained some shows and DJs who had presented under the Vibe brand, but also offered shows that were simulcast by one DJ across two or all three stations including international high-profile DJs such as Armin Van Buuren and John Digweed.
Kiss 105-108 used to be broadcast from Reflection House, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, however now relays Kiss 100 for everything.
