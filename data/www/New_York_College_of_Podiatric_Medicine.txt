The New York College of Podiatric Medicine (NYCPM) is a private specialized college located at 53 East 124th Street, Harlem, in New York City. Founded in 1911, NYCPM was the first Podiatric Medical school established in the United States. NYCPM was founded by Dr. Maurice J.

A minimum of 90 credit hours of undergraduate studies is a prerequisite for admission. New York College of Podiatric Medicine is the oldest and largest podiatric medical school in the U.S. The Foot Center of New York, its associated training center, sees nearly 20,000 patient visits a year, making it the largest foot clinic in the world.
