Flying Tigers (a.k.a. Yank Over Singapore and Yanks Over the Burma Road) is a 1942 black-and-white war film from Republic Pictures, produced by Edmund Grainger, directed by David Miller, and starring John Wayne, John Carroll, and Anna Lee.
Flying Tigers dramatizes the exploits of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), Americans already fighting the enemy in China prior to the U. S. entry into World War II. It is unabashedly a wartime propaganda film that was well received by a 1940s audience looking for a patriotic "flagwaver".
