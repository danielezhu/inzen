The Moers Festival is an international jazz festival in Moers, Germany, happening yearly every Whitsun.
Many famous musicians have appeared there, including Fred Frith, David Murray, Cecil Taylor, Lester Bowie, Herbie Hancock, Abdullah Ibrahim, Archie Shepp, Sun Ra, and Jan Garbarek.
Over the years the festival's music character has changed from pure free jazz to include world music and crossovers with popular music. Today it includes all kinds of jazz-related music, though still with many experimental and avant-garde performers.
