The 2018 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 6, 2018. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states. Non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories will also be elected. The winners of this election will serve in the 116th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2010 United States Census. Republicans have held a House majority since the 2010 elections, although they lost six seats in the 2016 elections.
These midterm elections will take place halfway through Republican President Donald J. Trump's first of possible two terms. The 2018 Senate elections, 2018 gubernatorial elections, and many state and local elections will also be held on this date.
