The Last Trane is an album credited to jazz musician John Coltrane, released in 1966 on Prestige Records, catalogue 7378.
It is assembled from unissued results of three separate recording sessions at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey in 1957 and 1958. Coltrane was a sideman on all the original sessions, which were led by trumpeter Donald Byrd, pianist Red Garland or drummer Art Taylor. Last Trane was an example of Prestige capitalizing on Coltrane's fame which grew during the 1960s long after he had stopped recording for the label. Prestige would reissue recordings on which he had originally been a sideman as if he were the leader, or like Last Trane used unissued recordings to create new marketable albums without Coltrane's input or approval.
