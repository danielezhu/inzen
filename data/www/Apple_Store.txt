Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc., dealing with computers and consumer electronics. The stores sell Macintosh personal computers, software, iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and select third-party accessories. All stores offer a Genius Bar for technical support and repairs, free product workshops for the public, youth programs (workshops, field trips, Apple Camps); some high-profile stores feature a theater for presentations and workshops and a studio for training with Apple products. Under the leadership of Ron Johnson, the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in The New York Times, been responsible for "[turning] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets". Apple Stores have a standardized appearance with light wood tables and a general minimal design.
With global sales of US$16 billion in merchandise in 2011, Apple leads the United States retail market in terms of sales per unit area. Apple has 490 retail stores in 20 countries and an online store available in 39 countries.
