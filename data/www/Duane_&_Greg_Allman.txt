Duane & Greg Allman is the second studio album by the rock and roll band The 31st of February, recorded at TK Studios, Hialeah, Florida in September 1968. The planned album was never completed as the band broke up shortly afterwards, and the demo recordings remained unreleased until Bold Records released this album in May 1972. It was then attributed to Duane and Gregg Allman â€” with name mis-spelled 'Greg'. The brothers had in the mean time established themselves in The Allman Brothers Band along with Butch Trucks, original drummer of The 31st of February.
Bolder Records released the opening track "Morning Dew" as a single in 1972, backed with "I'll Change for You". Neither the single nor the album made it into the record charts.
The album was re-released several times after 1972 on various record companies and with varying cover art in various countries, including Germany and Japan.
