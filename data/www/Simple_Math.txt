Simple Math is the third studio album from Atlanta-based indie rock band Manchester Orchestra. It was released on May 10, 2011 through independent label Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, itself distributed by Sony Music Entertainment. The album was recorded with Dan Hannon who also produced the band's first album, and co-produced their second.
Andy Hull, the band's lyricist and vocalist, has said that Simple Math is a concept album, telling a story from his own perspective; "It's a story about a 23-year old who questions everything from marriage to love to religion to sex. Sometimes even for myself, it’s difficult to decipher which one I’m actually talking to. Everything I’ve written in the past has been about those things. This album is the most realized form of my questioning." A week prior to its official release, the entire album was available for streaming on their official website.
Led by the title track and single "Simple Math", the album was a success for the band, obtaining praise from music critics and debuting at a career-high number twenty one on the Billboard 200 and number eight on the Billboard Rock Albums chart with opening week sales of 18,000 units.
