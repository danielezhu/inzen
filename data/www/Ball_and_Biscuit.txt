"Ball and Biscuit" is the eighth track on the album Elephant by American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It is recognizable for its use of Blues as a musical theme, its quiet-loud motif and its heavily distorted guitar solos. As a result of the recurrent jams throughout the song, it is the longest studio track recorded by the band at 7:19. It was never released as a single, but has since become widely used in pop culture and a perennial favorite of fans.
