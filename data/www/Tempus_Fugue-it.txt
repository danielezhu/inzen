"Tempus Fugue-it" (also known as "Tempus Fugit") is a 1949 jazz composition by jazz pianist Bud Powell. It has been recorded by Powell, Miles Davis and many others.
Not actually a fugue, its title is a play on words, meaning "time flies" (tempus fugit), a reflection of the speed at which it is played.
