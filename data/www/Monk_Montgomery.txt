William Howard "Monk" Montgomery (October 10, 1921 â€“ May 20, 1982) was an American jazz bassist. He was a pioneer of the electric bass; possibly the first to record on the instrument in a 1953 session led by trumpeter Art Farmer. He was the brother of noted guitarist Wes Montgomery and vibraphonist Buddy Montgomery.
