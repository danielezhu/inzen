Larry Young (also known as Khalid Yasin [Abdul Aziz]; 7 October 1940, in Newark, New Jersey â€“ 30 March 1978, in New York City) was an American jazz organist and occasional pianist. Young pioneered a modal approach to the Hammond B-3 (in contrast to Jimmy Smith's soul jazz style). However, he did also play soul jazz, among other styles.
