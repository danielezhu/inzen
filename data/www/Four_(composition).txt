"Four" is a 1954 jazz standard composed by the American jazz saxophonist Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson and mistakenly, perhaps  attributed to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. It was first recorded in 1954 by Miles Davis and released in 1956 on his album Blue Haze. Jon Hendricks added lyrics to both the head and to Davis' solo.
