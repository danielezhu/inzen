The Boston Cannons are a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) professional men's field lacrosse team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They have played in the MLL since the 2001 season and won the MLL Championship in 2011. From 2006 to 2008, they were in the Eastern Conference. From the league's inception in 2001 through 2005, they were in the American Division. With the MLL contraction for the 2009 season from 10 to 6 teams (due to the state of the U.S. economy), there is currently only one division/conference. The team's home field is Harvard Stadium, but played at Gillette Stadium during the 2015 season.
