Hot Latin Songs (formerly Hot Latin Tracks and Hot Latin 50) is a record chart published by Billboard magazine. It is often recognized as the most important music chart for Spanish language Latin music in the American music market. It was established by the magazine on September 6, 1986 with La Guirnalda by Rocío Dúrcal being the first song to reach number one. The chart was originally based on airplay on Latin music radio stations. Songs on the chart were not necessarily in Spanish language, since the chart inception a few songs in English language and Portuguese also have charted. In 1994, three charts were introduced in addition to Hot Latin Songs: Latin Pop Airplay, which deals with pop songs whether or not it is Spanish-language; Latin Regional Mexican Airplay, which dealt with different styles of Mexican genres; and Latin Tropical Airplay, which focuses on the genres of tropical music. In 2005, the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart was introduced in response to the growing influence of Latin hip hop and reggaeton. Listings of the Hot Latin Songs are also shown on Telemundo's music page through a partnership between the two companies. On October 11, 2012, Billboard updated the methodology for the Hot Latin Songs chart to include sales of digital downloads and streaming activity in addition to airplay. Furthermore, only predominantly Spanish-language songs are now eligible to appear on the chart. The airplay-only chart for Latin music continues to exist as the Latin Airplay chart.
