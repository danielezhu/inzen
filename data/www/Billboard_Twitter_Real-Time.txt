The Billboard Twitter Real-Time charts are four interactive Billboard music magazine charts first published on May 27, 2014. The chart ranks trending songs from popular and emerging artists based on how often they are mentioned in messages called "tweets" sent by social networking site Twitter in the United States.
The charts "Trending 140", "Emerging Artists", "Weekly Top Tracks" and "Weekly Emerging Artists" are reported to define how fans interact with, and influence, popular content by ranking the most popular songs being shared on Twitter in the U.S. The first two charts update on a "real-time" minute-by-minute basis, with the last two charts providing weekly summaries.
