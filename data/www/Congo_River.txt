The Congo River (also known as the Zaire River; French: (le) fleuve Congo/Zaïre; Portuguese: rio Congo/Zaire; Kongo: Nzâdi Kôngo) is the second longest river in Africa after Nile and the second largest river in the world by discharge volume of water (after the Amazon), and the world's deepest river with measured depths in excess of 220 m (720 ft). The Congo-Chambeshi river has an overall length of 4,700 km (2,920 mi), which makes it the ninth-longest river (in terms of discharge, the Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River, Lualaba being the name of the Congo River upstream of the Boyoma Falls, extending for 1,800 km). Measured along the Lualaba, the Congo River has a total length of 4,370 km (2,715 mi). It crosses the equator twice.
The Congo Basin has a total area of about 4 million km2, or 13% of the entire African landmass.
