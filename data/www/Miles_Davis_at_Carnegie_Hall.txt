Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall is a live album by American jazz musician Miles Davis. Subtitled The Legendary Performances of May 19, 1961, it was released by Columbia Records as CL 1812 in monaural and CS 8612 as "electronically re-channeled for stereo."
This live performance features Davis with his regular quintet and also accompanied by Gil Evans and his 21-piece orchestra. The orchestra is heard on several selections drawn from Miles Ahead as well as a complete reading of the adagio movement from Concierto de Aranjuez as recorded on Sketches of Spain.
The concert begins with the orchestra playing the Gil Evans introduction to "So What", which is performed by the quintet, and then segues directly into the only recording of an Evans arrangement of "Spring is Here".
