Founded by Walt Disney to oversee the production of Disneyland, it was originally known as Walt Disney Inc. then WED Enterprises, from the initials meaning "Walter Elias Disney", the company co-founder's full name.
Imagineering is responsible for designing and building Disney theme parks, resorts, cruise ships, and other entertainment venues at all levels of project development.
