Tedeschi Food Shops is a chain of nearly 200 convenience stores (as of March 2015), located primarily in Massachusetts, with some stores in New Hampshire. It was acquired by 7- Eleven in May 2015, and the transaction closed in August 2015. According to a spokesman for 7-Eleven, conversion of the Tedeschi-branded stores to the 7-Eleven banner will be gradual.
