The Golden River City Jazz Festival is an annual music festival in Kortrijk, Belgium, on the first weekend in September coinciding with the local 'September' Braderie, focussing on Jazz. The Festival was an opportunity for The Golden River City Jazz Band to showcase their repertoire and to mingle with international musicians. No less than 30 times the Golden River City Jazz Band played a major role at the annual festival in its hometown. The real breakthrough occurred in 1973 when the band had the opportunity to accompany the British lady-singer Beryl Bryden.
