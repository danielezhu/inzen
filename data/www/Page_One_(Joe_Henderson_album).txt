Page One is the debut release by American jazz tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. It features some of Henderson's most well-known pieces such as "Recorda Me," later to become a jazz standard, and "Out of the Night", originally written in 1957. The front cover lists "Joe Henderson/Kenny Dorham/Butch Warren/Pete La Roca, etc.". Only McCoy Tyner's name is absent. Bob Blumenthal explains, in his 1999 liner notes, that Tyner had just signed with Impulse!, so this first Blue Note appearance was not very adherent to the contract.
AllMusic describes the album as a "particularly strong and historic effort". According to All About Jazz, Page One, which introduced the Jazz standard "Blue Bossa", is still one of Henderson's "most critically acclaimed albums". PopMatters, by contrast, prefers later works, indicating in one review that Page One "has the careful feel of a leaderâ€™s first session". The album was identified by Scott Yanow in his Allmusic essay "Hard Bop" as one of the 17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings.
The album was released on CD in 1988 by Blue Note and has been in print consistently since.
