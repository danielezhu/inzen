D-flat major is a major scale based on D-flat, consisting of the pitches D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭ and C. Its key signature has five flats.
Its relative minor is B♭ minor. Its parallel minor, D♭ minor, is usually replaced by C♯ minor, since D♭ minor features a B in its key signature and C♯ minor only has four sharps, making it rare for D♭ minor to be used. C♯ major, with seven sharps, has a similar problem. Therefore, D♭ major is often used as the parallel major for C♯ minor. The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of A♭ major and G♯ minor, with A♭ minor having seven flats and G♯ major having eight sharps, including the F. For example, in his Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major ("Raindrop"), Frédéric Chopin switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor for the middle section in the parallel minor, while in his Fantaisie-Impromptu, primarily in C-sharp minor, he switches to D-flat major for the middle section for the opposite reason. Ferdinand Ries' third concerto likewise switches to D-flat major for a while for the return of the second theme in the first movement. Claude Debussy also switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor in the significant section in his famous Clair de lune. Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony likewise switches to C-sharp minor for a while for the significant section in the slow movement.

D♭ major is enharmonic to C♯ major. In music for the harp, D-flat major would be preferable, not only because harp strings are more resonant in the flat position and the key has fewer accidentals, but also because modulation to the dominant key is easier (by putting the G pedal in the natural position, whereas there is no double-sharp position in which to put the F pedal for G-sharp major).
