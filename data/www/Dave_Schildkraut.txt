Dave Schildkraut (January 7, 1925 – January 1, 1998) was an American jazz alto saxophonist.
Schildkraut first played professionally with Louis Prima in 1941. Following this he played with Buddy Rich (1946), Anita O'Day (1947), Stan Kenton (1953–54), Pete Rugolo (1954), Oscar Pettiford (1954), Miles Davis ("Solar" on: Walkin', Prestige, 1954), George Handy (1955), Tony Aless (1955), Ralph Burns, Tito Puente, Johnny Richards, and Kenton again in 1959. From the 1960s, he played freelance in New York City, where he appeared regularly with Eddie Bert at the West End Cafe. Later in his life he went into semi-retirement.
Schildkraut's playing was fluid and brilliant in pure bebop style: so much so that, bassist Charles Mingus misidentified him as the iconic Charlie Parker during a "blindfold test" with jazz writer Leonard Feather that was published in Down Beat.
He recorded only one album as a leader, in 1979. However, the album was released only in 2000 by Endgame Records as Last Date. By this time, Schidkraut's playing was described as having grown from his youthful mimicry of Parker by showing influence from the likes of John Coltrane, Warne Marsh and Lee Konitz.
