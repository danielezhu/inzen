The Wes Montgomery Trio (or A Dynamic New Sound: Guitar Organ Drums) is the third album by American jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery, released in 1959. It has been reissued by Original Jazz Classics.
The track "Missile Blues" is named after the club Montgomery regularly played at in Indianapolis before his move to New York to record for Riverside. It was at this club that he first met producer Orrin Keepnews.
