8K resolution or 8K UHD is the current highest ultra high definition television (UHDTV) resolution in digital television and digital cinematography. 8K refers to the horizontal resolution of 7,680 pixels, forming the total image dimensions of (7680Ã—4320). Otherwise known as 4320p. 
8K UHD has two times the horizontal and vertical resolution of the 4K UHD with four times as many pixels overall, or sixteen times as many pixels as Full HD.
High-resolution displays such as 8K allow the user to have each pixel be indistinguishable to the human eye from an acceptable distance to the screen. 8K resolution can also be used with the purpose of enhancing lesser resolution videos with a combination of cropping technique and/or with downsampling technique used in video and film editing. Resolutions such as 8K allows filmmakers to shoot in a high resolution with a wide lens or at a further distance in the case of potentially dangerous subjects (such as in wildlife documentaries), by intending to zoom and crop digitally in post-production. In this, a portion of the original image is cropped to match a smaller resolution such as the current industry standard for high-definition televisions (4K, 1080p, and 720p).
8K display resolution is the successor to 4K resolution. TV manufacturers pushed to make 4K a new standard by 2017. The feasibility of a fast transition to this new standard is often questionable in view of the absence of broadcasting resources.
As of 2015, few cameras had the capability to shoot video in 8K, with NHK being one of the only companies to have created a small broadcasting camera with an 8K image sensor. By 2016 Red Digital Cinema Camera Company had delivered three 8K cameras in both a Full Frame sensor and Super 35 sensor. Until major sources are available, 8K is unlikely to become a mainstream resolution but filmmakers are pushing for 8K cameras in its advantage to get better 4K footage.
