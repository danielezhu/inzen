Harvard College, around which Harvard University eventually grew, was founded 1636 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. For centuries its graduates dominated Massachusetts' clerical and civil ranks, and beginning in the 19th century its stature became national, then international, as a dozen graduate and professional schools were formed alongside the nucleus undergraduate College. Historically influential in national roles are the schools of medicine (1782), law (1817) and business (1908) as well as the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1890). Since the late 19th century Harvard has been one of the most prestigious schools in the world, its library system and financial endowment larger than those of any other.
