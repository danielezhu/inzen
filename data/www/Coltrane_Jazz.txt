Coltrane Jazz is the sixth studio album by jazz musician John Coltrane, released in 1961 on Atlantic Records, catalogue SD 1354. The song "Village Blues" is noted as a landmark recording, as it marks the first session date of the early John Coltrane Quartet on record. Featured alongside Coltrane are pianist McCoy Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones, and bassist Steve Davis (who would within 18 months have been replaced by first Reggie Workman and then Jimmy Garrison who would stay with Coltrane until his death.)
