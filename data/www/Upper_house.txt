An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and may have different set of powers than the lower house. The upper house is often a less democratic body, with members serving longer terms between elections, or representing entities such as counties or states rather than districts of equal population. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.
A legislature composed of only one house (and which therefore has neither an upper house nor a lower house) is described as unicameral.
