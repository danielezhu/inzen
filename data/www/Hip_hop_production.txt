Hip hop production is the creation of hip hop music in a recording studio. While the term encompasses all aspects of hip hop music creation, including recording the rapping of an MC, a turntablist or DJ providing a beat, playing samples and "scratching" using record players, and the creation of a rhythmic backing track, using a drum machine, sequencer and synthesizers, it is most commonly used to refer to recording the instrumental, non-lyrical and non-vocal aspects of hip hop.
Hip hop producers are the instrumentalists and creative directors involved in guiding a recording session, which can range from a single song to a major album. Although 1970s-era hip hop focused on turntables and a DJ mixer, in the 2010s, hip hop production uses a range of digital samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. Sometimes hip hop producers use traditional instruments, such as a drum kit or electric bass.
A hip hop instrumental is colloquially referred to as a beat, and its composer is referred to as a producer or beatmaker. In the studio, however, a hip hop producer also functions as a traditional record producer, being the person who is ultimately responsible for the final sound of a recording, for guiding the artists and performers and giving advice to the audio engineer on the selection of microphones and effects processors and on how the mix the levels of the rapping and beats.
