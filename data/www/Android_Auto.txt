Android Auto is a smartphone projection standard developed by Google to allow mobile devices running the Android operating system (version 5.0 "Lollipop" and later) to be operated in automobiles through the dashboard's head unit. Android Auto was announced on June 25, 2014, at Google I/O 2014. The Android Auto mobile app was released on March 19, 2015.
The standard offers drivers control over GPS mapping/navigation, music playback, SMS, telephony, and web search; both touchscreen and button-controlled head unit displays will be supported, although hands-free operation through voice commands is emphasized to ensure safe driving. Compatible apps include Google Maps, Google Play Music, MLB at Bat, Skype, Spotify, Songza, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, Radioplayer, TuneIn, WhatsApp and WeChat.
While the official Android Auto website does list most car manufacturers as supporting Android Auto, many vehicles which are released for the 2015 and 2016 model years do not officially support it just yet.
Android Auto is part of the Open Automotive Alliance, which was announced on January 6, 2014, and is a joint effort with 28 automobile manufacturers and mobile tech supplier Nvidia. In May 2015, Hyundai became the first manufacturer to offer Android Auto, making it available first in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata.
