Jazz Way Out is an album by jazz musicians John Coltrane and Wilbur Harden, the second of the three Savoy 1958 recordings made by Coltrane and Harden together. The session also produced an alternate take of "Dial Africa", which can be found on some compilations, most notably the ones featuring the complete Savoy recordings made by Harden and Coltrane together, The Complete Mainstream 1958 Sessions (2009) and The Complete Savoy Sessions (1999).
