In music, a canon is a contrapuntal (counterpoint-based) compositional technique or texture that employs a melody with one or more imitations of the melody played after a given duration (e.g., quarter rest, one measure, etc.). The initial melody is called the leader (or dux), while the imitative melody, which is played in a different voice, is called the follower (or comes). The follower must imitate the leader, either as an exact replication of its rhythms and intervals or some transformation thereof (see "Types of canon", below). Repeating canons in which all voices are musically identical are called rounds—"Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and "Frère Jacques" being widely known examples.

Why are some composers fascinated with canons? Canons are not unlike puzzles and other brainteasers: from just a few rules, you can achieve so much. Plus, canons have the appeal of any puzzle. There is the initial challenge, the mystery of solving it, and the feeling of satisfaction you get from completing it. (Davidian 2015, 136)

Accompanied canon is a canon accompanied by one or more additional independent parts which do not take part in imitating the melody.
