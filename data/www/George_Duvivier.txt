George Duvivier (August 17, 1920 â€“ July 11, 1985) was an American jazz double-bass player.

Duvivier was born in New York City and took up the cello and also the violin while in high school before settling on the bass. He also learned composition and scoring before going out on the road with Lucky Millinder and then with the Cab Calloway bands of the early 1940s after a stint in the army. He was an excellent composer and scored many tunes for those two big bands. He was a freelance bassist for most of his life, never belonging to any one particular group for any extended period of time, but played with some of jazz's greatest. He was Bud Powell's bassist in 1953, during the sessions for The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2, for which he contributed arrangements. He was a member of Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis' quartet with organist Shirley Scott and drummer Arthur Edgehill from 1957 to 1959 and continued playing with Scott through the 1960s. In 1956, Duvivier played in the orchestra in the movie The Benny Goodman Story.
During the 1970s he was a member of Soprano Summit.
One of his last performances was on Late Night with David Letterman in 1983, accompanying singer-songwriter Tom Waits.
Duvivier died of cancer in his Manhattan home. He never recorded as a session leader.
