Anthony McLeod Kennedy (born July 23, 1936) is the senior Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on November 11, 1987, and took the oath of office on February 18, 1988.
Kennedy became the most senior Associate Justice on the court following the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Since the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006, he has been the swing vote on many of the Court's 5â€“4 decisions. He has authored the majority opinion in many of these cases, including Boumediene v. Bush and Citizens United v. FEC. Kennedy wrote in part the per curiam majority opinions in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Bush v. Gore. He is also notable for his majority opinions in each of the Court's landmark gay rights cases: Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas, United States v. Windsor, and Obergefell v. Hodges.
