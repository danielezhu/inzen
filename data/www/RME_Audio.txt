RME Audio is a German company, based in Haimhausen, that designs and builds professional audio hardware, including audio interfaces, analog to digital converters, and digital-to-analog converters. While the majority of their audio interface systems are PCI-based as well as PCI-Express, they released their first FireWire based system, the Fireface 800 in 2004. Since 2009/2010 USB and USB+FireWire systems are available, the Fireface UC and the Fireface UFX. Their products have been shipped with Nuendo, and were often rebranded as such.
