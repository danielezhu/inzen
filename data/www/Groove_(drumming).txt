In drumming, a groove is a repeated phrase that sets and maintains the rhythm and tempo of the piece.
Grooves and fills are the main components of the music played on a drum kit, and together with basic techniques or rudiments such as flams make up the curriculum for learning to play the drum kit.
To a drummer, a groove is the drumming equivalent of a riff to a guitarist.
