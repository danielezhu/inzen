Dominican Rock (known as "Rock Dominicano" in Dominican Republic) is rock music created by Dominican groups and soloists. Originating in the 1980s with the start of Luis Dias' band Transporte Urbano, successful bands such as Tribu Del Sol, Toque Profundo and Tabu Tek began to emerge. Dominican rock is listened to by the youth of the Dominican Republic who have embraced the music, sometimes over merengue and bachata. Rita Indiana y los Misterios are a musical group known for their blend of traditional merengue music with rock.
