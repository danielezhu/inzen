A concerto (—plural concertos, anglicised from the Italian concerti (which is also used in English)—is a musical composition, whose characteristics have changed over time. In the 17th century, "sacred works for voices and orchestra were typically called concertos." J. S. Bach "...was thus reflecting a long-standing tradition when he used the title 'concerto' for many of the works that we know as cantatas." However, in recent centuries and up to the present, a concerto is a piece usually composed in three parts or movements, in which (usually) one solo instrument (for instance, a piano, violin, cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band.
