The Man and The Journey are two album-length suites of music performed in concert by Pink Floyd during their 1969 tour. They consist of several of their early songs, some unreleased songs, and material later included on Soundtrack from the Film More and Ummagumma. The concerts featured visual performance elements such as the sawing and construction of a table, and consumption of afternoon tea onstage.
