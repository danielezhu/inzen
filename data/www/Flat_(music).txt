In music, flat, or bemolle (Italian: "soft B") means "lower in pitch". In music notation, the flat symbol, ‚ô≠, derived from a stylised lowercase "b", lowers a note by a half step (semitone). Intonation or tuning is said to be flat when it is below the true pitch.
Flat accidentals are used in the key signatures of F major/D minor, B‚ô≠ major/G minor, E‚ô≠ major/C minor, A‚ô≠ major/F minor, D‚ô≠ major/B‚ô≠ minor, and the less frequently used keys of G‚ô≠ major/E‚ô≠ minor, C‚ô≠ major/A‚ô≠ minor. The order of flats in the key signatures of music notation, following the circle of fifths, is B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, A‚ô≠, D‚ô≠, G‚ô≠, C‚ô≠, and F‚ô≠. A mnemonic for this is: Before Eating A Doughnut Get Coffee First.

The Unicode character ‚ô≠ (U+266D) can be found in the block Miscellaneous Symbols; its HTML entity is &#9837;.
Under twelve tone equal temperament, C‚ô≠ for instance is the same as, or enharmonically equivalent to, B‚ôÆ (B-natural), and G‚ô≠ is the same as F‚ôØ (F-sharp). In any other tuning system, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.
Double flats also exist, which look like  (similar to two flats, ‚ô≠‚ô≠) and lower a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Less often (for instance in microtonal music notation) one will encounter half, or three-quarter, or otherwise altered flats. The Unicode character ùÑ´ (U+1D12B) in the Musical Symbols block represents the double-flat sign.
Although very uncommon, a triple flat () can sometimes be found. It lowers a note three semitones.
A quarter-tone flat or half flat, indicating the use of quarter tones, may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash () or a reversed flat sign (). Play  A three-quarter-tone flat, flat and a half or sesquiflat, is represented by a half flat and a regular flat ().
