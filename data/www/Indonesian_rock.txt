Rock Indo (Indonesian:Rock Indo) is rock music from Indonesia, a product of the culture and globalizing outlook of the country, similar to this genre's music globally. Indonesian-specific ideas about individualism, interdependency, modernism, and the supernatural have also been observed in the rock videos and music of the nation. Some Indonesian rock bands sometimes perform in the Dangdut style, which was created as a reaction to the influx of popular American music into the country in the 1960s. Due to the politicizing of the Dangdut form in the 1980s, forms of rock which contained more foreign influences came to represent dissent from the Suharto government.
One of the largest rock festivals in Indonesia is the Jakarta Rock Parade, a 3-day festival recently hosting over 100 bands.
