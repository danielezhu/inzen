Well temperament (also good temperament, circular or circulating temperament) is a type of tempered tuning described in 20th-century music theory. The term is modeled on the German word wohltemperiert that appears in the title of J.S. Bach's famous composition, The Well-Tempered Clavier. The phrase wohl temperiert first appeared in Musikalische Temperatur (1691) by Bach's predecessor Andreas Werckmeister (1645â€“1706), an organ tuner and music theorist.
