From a merge: This is a redirect from a page that was merged into another page. This redirect was kept in order to preserve this page's edit history after its content was merged into the target page's content. Please do not remove the tag that generates this text (unless the need to recreate content on this page has been demonstrated) nor delete this page.
For redirects with substantive page histories that did not result from page merges use {{R with history}} instead.

To an embedded anchor: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to an anchored part of a page on the subject.
An {{anchor|(anchor name)}} template, a <span id="(anchor name)"> element, or an |id=(anchor name) parameter might be installed at the beginning of a paragraph, in or near a section header or within a table. The anchor might also be an old section header that has been edited and is anchored within or near the new header to prevent broken internal and external links.
Even though section headers of the general form ==(Header name)== are themselves a type of anchor, use {{R to section}} instead.
