To Whom Who Keeps a Record is a compilation album credited to jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, released by the Japanese subsidiary Warner Pioneer of Warner Bros. Records in 1975. The album was assembled without Coleman's input, comprising outtakes from Atlantic Records recording sessions of 1959 and 1960 for Change of the Century and This Is Our Music. Sessions for "Music Always" took place at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, California; all others at Atlantic Studios in New York City. The track titles spell out 'music always brings goodness to us all, p.s. unless one has some other motive for its use.'
