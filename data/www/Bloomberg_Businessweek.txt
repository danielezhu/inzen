## History[edit]

_Businessweek_ was first published in September 1929, weeks before the stock
market crash of 1929. The magazine provided information and opinions on what
was happening in the business world at the time. Early sections of the
magazine included marketing, labor, finance, management and Washington
Outlook, which made _Businessweek_ one of the first publications to cover
national political issues that directly impacted the business world.[4]

_Businessweek_ was originally published to be a resource for business
managers. However, in the 1970s, the magazine shifted its strategy and added
consumers outside the business world.[2] Since 1975, _Businessweek_ has
carried more annual advertising pages than any other magazine in the United
States.[5]

Stephen B. Shepard served as editor-in-chief from 1984 until 2005 when he was
chosen to be the founding dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.
Under Shepard, _Businessweek_ 's readership grew to more than six million in
the late 1980s.[6] He was succeeded by Stephen J. Adler of _The Wall Street
Journal_.[7]

###  Bloomberg L.P. acquisition[edit]

_Businessweek_ suffered a decline during the late-2000s recession as
advertising revenues fell one-third by the start of 2009 and the magazine's
circulation fell to 936,000. In July 2009, it was reported that McGraw-Hill
was trying to sell _Businessweek_ and had hired Evercore Partners to conduct
the sale. Because of the magazine's liabilities, it was suggested that it
might change hands for the nominal price of $1 to an investor who was willing
to incur losses turning the magazine around.[8]

In late 2009, Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine—reportedly for between $2
million to $5 million plus assumption of liabilities—and renamed it _Bloomberg
BusinessWeek_.[9][10] It is now believed McGraw-Hill received the high end of
the speculated price, at $5 million, along with the assumption of debt.
Currently, the magazine still loses $30 million per year, about half of the
$60 million it was reported losing in 2009.[11] Adler resigned as editor-in-
chief and was replaced by Josh Tyrangiel, who had been deputy managing editor
of _Time_ magazine.[12] In early 2010, the magazine title was restyled
_Bloomberg Businessweek_ (with a lowercase "w") as part of a redesign.[13]

##  Recent history[edit]

Megan Murphy is the third editor of the magazine in the eight years of
Bloomberg ownership. The magazine is reportedly losing between $20-$30 million
a year.[3] In June 2017, the magazine underwent substantial changes, taking it
more upmarket and closer to peers such as The Economist. The graphic design
became more serious/less playful and various sections such as "Etc." were
dropped.[ _citation needed_ ]

## Business school rankings[edit]

Since 1988, _Businessweek_ has published annual rankings of United States
business school MBA programs.[14] In 2006, it also started publishing annual
rankings of undergraduate business programs.[15]

##  Additional versions[edit]

International editions of _Businessweek_ were available on newsstands in
Europe and Asia until 2005 when publication of regional editions was suspended
to help increase foreign readership of customized European and Asian versions
of _Businessweek's_ website.[16] However, the same year the Russian edition
was launched in collaboration with Rodionov Publishing House.[17]

At the same time, _Businessweek_ partnered with InfoPro Management, a
publishing and market research company based in Beirut, Lebanon, to produce
the Arabic version of the magazine in 22 Arab countries.[18]

In 2011, _Bloomberg Businessweek_ continued the magazine's international
expansion and announced plans to introduce a Polish-language edition called
_Bloomberg Businessweek Polska_ , as well as a Chinese edition which was
relaunched in November 2011.[19][20][21]

_Bloomberg Businessweek_ launched an iPad version of the magazine using
Apple's subscription billing service in 2011.[22][23] The iPad edition was the
first to use this subscription method, which allows one to subscribe via an
iTunes account.[24] There are over 100,000 subscribers to the iPad edition of
_Businessweek_.[25]

##  Honors and awards[edit]

In 2011, _Adweek_ named _Bloomberg Businessweek_ as the top business magazine
in the country.[26] In 2012, _Bloomberg Businessweek_ won the general
excellence award for general-interest magazines at the National Magazine
Awards.[27] Also in 2012, _Bloomberg Businessweek_ editor Josh Tyrangiel was
named magazine editor of the year by _Ad Age_.[28] In 2014, _Bloomberg
Businessweek_ won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers Best in
Business award for magazines, general excellence.[29]
