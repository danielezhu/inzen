John Harvard (26 November 1607 – 14 September 1638) was an English minister in America, "a godly gentleman and a lover of learning", whose deathbed bequest to the "schoale or Colledge" recently undertaken by the Massachusetts Bay Colony was so gratefully received that it was consequently ordered "that the Colledge agreed upon formerly to bee built at Cambridg shalbee called Harvard Colledge."  Despite a persistent myth to the contrary, John Harvard is properly considered one of the founders of Harvard College.
A statue in his honor is a prominent feature of Harvard Yard.
