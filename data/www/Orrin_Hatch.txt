Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American politician who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, since January 2015.
A member of the Republican Party, he serves as the senior United States Senator for Utah. In office since 1977, Hatch is the most senior Republican Senator, the second-most senior Senator overall, after Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who has served since 1975. Having served for 40 years, 177 days, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history.
Hatch served as either the chairman or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the Board of Directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
After the Republicans won control of the Senate during the 2014 midterms, Hatch became president pro tempore on January 6, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in.
