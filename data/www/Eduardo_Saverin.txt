Eduardo Luiz Saverin (Portuguese pronunciation: [eduˈaɾdu luˈis ˈsaveɾĩ]; born 19 March 1982) is a Brazilian Internet entrepreneur, economist and angel investor. Saverin is one of the co-founders of Facebook. As of 2015, he owns 53 million Facebook shares (approximately 0.4% of all outstanding shares) and has a net worth of $7.2 billion, according to Forbes. He has also invested in early-stage startups such as Qwiki and Jumio.
In what was seen by some as a move to avoid U.S. taxes, Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship in September 2011. According to Saverin, he renounced his citizenship because of his "interest in working and living in Singapore" where he has been since 2009. He avoided an estimated $700 million in capital gains taxes; this generated some media attention and controversy. Saverin denies that he left the U.S. to avoid paying taxes.
