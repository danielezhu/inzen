Anthony John "Tony" Crombie (né Kronenberg, 27 August 1925 – 18 October 1999) was an English jazz drummer, pianist, bandleader and composer. He was regarded as one of the finest jazz drummers and bandleaders, and occasional but very capable pianist and vibraphonist, to emerge in Britain, and as an energising influence on the British jazz scene across six decades.
