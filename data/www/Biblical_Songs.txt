Biblical Songs (Czech: Biblické písně) is a song cycle which consists of musical settings by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) of ten texts, selected by him, from the Book of Psalms. It was originally composed for low voice and piano (1894, Op. 99, B. 185). The first five songs were later orchestrated by the composer (1895, B. 189).
