Tenor Conclave is an album by Hank Mobley, Al Cohn, John Coltrane and Zoot Sims. The album was originally recorded in 1956 and issued in 1957 on Prestige Records as PRLP 7074, and was credited to the Prestige All Stars. However, as Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s after he had stopped recording for the label, Prestige would re-release it in 1962 as a new album, with a different cover prominently displaying Coltrane's name. This reissue of the album was given the catalogue number PRLP 7249.
