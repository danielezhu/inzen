Solo Monk is the eighth album Thelonious Monk released for Columbia Records in 1965. The album is composed entirely of solo piano work by Monk. The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek states "This is perhaps the solo piano record to have by Monk". In addition to various vinyl and CD issues, Sony Music Enterprises issued an SACD (SRGS 4520) in Japan.
