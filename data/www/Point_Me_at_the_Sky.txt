"Point Me at the Sky" is the fifth United Kingdom single by the British band Pink Floyd, released on 17 December 1968. The song was an early collaboration by bassist Roger Waters and guitarist David Gilmour. The single was not released in the United States, but was in Canada, Japan, and some European countries.
The vocals on the verse of the song are sung by Gilmour, and the bridge vocals are shared between Gilmour and Waters. Musically, the song starts out quietly and then becomes a heavy piece of psychedelic rock.
Promotional U.K. copies and some foreign releases mistakenly printed the title "Point Me to the Sky" on the label and or sleeve.
