Magic is a British music television station owned by The Box Plus Network. It plays mainly easy listening music videos and is based on the Magic Radio network also owned by Bauer. Like some other Box Television music television channels under Bauer's brand, Magic operated a jukebox service where viewers were able to request videos to be played via a premium-rate telephone number.
The channel is available on many platforms and is part of a network of channels owned by Box Television, which include 4Music, Kerrang! TV, Smash Hits, Heat, The Box, and Kiss. On 2 April 2013, all Box Television channels went free-to-air on satellite, apart from 4Music which went free-to-view. As a result, the channels were removed from the Sky EPG in Ireland. However, Magic launched on Freesat on 29 April 2013, alongside Heat, following the addition of four other Box Television channels on 15 April.
Magic mainly focuses on music from the 1970s (occasionally) 1980s, the 1990s and the 2000s.
