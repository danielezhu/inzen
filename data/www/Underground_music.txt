Underground music comprises musical genres beyond mainstream culture. Any song that is not being legally commercialized is considered underground. Such music may tend to express common ideas, such as high regard for sincerity and intimacy, freedom of creative expression as opposed to the highly formulaic composition of commercial music, and appreciation of artistic individuality as opposed to conformity to current mainstream trends. Apart from perhaps the underground rock scenes in the pre-Mikhail Gorbachev Soviet Union, very few types of underground music are completely hidden, although performances and recordings may be difficult for outsiders to find.
