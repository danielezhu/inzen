Typestry is an abandonware 3d software program released in the 1990s by Pixar for Apple Macintosh and Windows-based PC computer systems. Unlike general purpose modellers and renderers, Typestry concentrated on rendering and animating text entered by the user in multiple fonts. The fonts were extruded into three dimensions, with various bevel styles and textures applied during rendering. It was one of Pixar's only application software packages released on the open market. It was discontinued when Pixar chose to concentrate on film production instead of application development.[1]. Glimpse is an abandonware editor to modify looks, a resource used by Typestry.
