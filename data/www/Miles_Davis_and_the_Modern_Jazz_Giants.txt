Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants (PRLP 7150) is an album by Miles Davis, released on Prestige Records in 1959. Most of the material comes from a session on December 24, 1954 and October 26, 1956, featuring Thelonious Monk and Milt Jackson, and had been previously released in the discontinued ten inch LP format. "Swing Spring" was originally released on the 10"LP Miles Davis All Stars, Volume 1 (PRLP 196), and "Bemsha Swing" and "The Man I Love" (take 2) had been previously released on Volume 2 (PRLP 200). "'Round Midnight" is newly released, and comes from the same sessions by Davis's new quintet in 1956 which resulted in Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet (PRLP 7200) and three other albums to fulfill Davis's contract with Prestige.
