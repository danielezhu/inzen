The term backline is used in popular music and sound reinforcement system contexts to refer to electronic audio amplification equipment and speaker enclosures that are placed behind the band or the rhythm section on stage, including amplifiers and speaker cabinets for guitars, bass guitars and keyboards. In the US and Canada, the term has expanded to include many of the musical instruments that the rhythm section musicians play, including pianos, Hammond organs, drum kits and various percussion instruments such as congas and bongos.
