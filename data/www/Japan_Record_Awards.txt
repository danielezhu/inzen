The Japan Record Awards (日本レコード大賞, Nihon Rekōdo Taishō) is a major music awards show that recognizes outstanding achievements in the Japan Composer's Association in a manner similar to the American Grammy Awards, held annually in Japan. Until 2005, the show aired on New Year's Eve, but has since aired every December 30 on TBS Japan at 6:30 P.M JST and is hosted by many announcers.
EXILE holds the record for most wins, with four awards.
