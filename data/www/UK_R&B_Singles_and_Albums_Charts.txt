The UK R&B Singles Chart and the UK R&B Albums Chart (also known as The Official UK R&B Charts, the Top 40 RnB Singles and the Top 40 RnB Albums, or simply the UK Urban Chart) are 40-position R&B and hip hop music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the music industry in the United Kingdom. Although the charts do not receive any airplay, their compilation is viewed on the websites of the OCC and BBC Radio 1, as well as publications such as UKChartsPlus and Music Week. The UK R&B chart is also shown regularly on music channels including Kiss, Viva UK, MTV Base and MTV Hits. Additionally, the channels regularly use The Official UK R&B Download Chart, which is shown on 4Music.
The two charts are also compiled and shown on the BBC Radio 1 website. Criteria for inclusion in the chart is unclear, since it does not necessarily rely upon the positions of R&B and hip hop songs on the UK Singles Chart.
