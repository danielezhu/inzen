The Boston Globe (sometimes abbreviated as The Globe) is an American daily newspaper founded and based in Boston, Massachusetts since its creation by Charles H. Taylor in 1872. The newspaper has won a total of 26 Pulitzer Prizes as of 1966, and with a total paid circulation of 245,824 from September 2015 to August 2016, it is the 25th most read newspaper in the United States. The Boston Globe is the oldest and largest daily newspaper in Boston.
Founded in the later 19th century, the paper was mainly controlled by Irish Catholic interests before being sold to Charles H. Taylor and his family. After being privately held until 1973, it was sold to The New York Times in 1993 for $1.1 billion, making it one of the most expensive print purchases in U.S. history. Historically, the newspaper has been noted as "one of the nationâ€™s most prestigious papers," and was purchased by Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry for $70 million from the New York Times Company.
The paper's coverage of the 2001-2003 Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal, received international media attention and served as the basis of the 2015 American drama, Spotlight. The movie revolved around the Boston Globe Spotlight Team, a team of investigative journalists tasked with uncovering intricacies of a single topic or story.
