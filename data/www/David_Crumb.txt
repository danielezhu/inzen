David Crumb (born May 21, 1962) is a contemporary composer born into a musical family. His father is composer George Crumb, and his sister is singer Ann Crumb. His music is not as avant-garde or experimental as his father's; it has been called "attractive, accessible, imaginative, well-crafted" by the Chicago-Sun Times, and "expressive and beautiful" by the American Record Guide: reviews listed on the Presser bio.
