Australian folk music is a term which may be applied to traditional music from the large variety of immigrant cultures and those of the original Australian inhabitants.
Celtic, English, German and Scandinavian folk traditions predominated in the first wave of European immigrant music. The Australian tradition is, in this sense, related to the traditions of other countries with similar ethnic, historical and political origins, such as New Zealand, Canada and the United States.
