Jazz Journal is a British jazz magazine established in 1946 by Sinclair Traill (1904â€“1981). It was originally published in London under the title Pick Up, which Traill founded as a locus for serious jazz criticism in Britain. In May 1948, Traill, using his own money, relaunched it as Jazz Journal. Traill, for the rest of his life, served as its editor-in-chief. Jazz Journal is Britain's longest enduring jazz magazine.
