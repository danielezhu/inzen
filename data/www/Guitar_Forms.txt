Guitar Forms is a 1965 album by Kenny Burrell, featuring arrangements by Gil Evans. However, the presence of the Evans' orchestra is somewhat misleading, as it appears on only five of the album's nine tracks; the most ambitious of these is the nearly 10-minute "Lotus Land." Three tracks are blues numbers in a small group format, and there is one solo performance: "Prelude #2."
