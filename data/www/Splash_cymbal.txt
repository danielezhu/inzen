In a drum kit, splash cymbals are the smallest accent cymbals. Splash cymbals and china cymbals are the main types of effects cymbals.
The most common sized splash has a diameter of 10", followed by 8". Most splash cymbals are in the size range of 6" to 13", but some splash cymbals are as small as 4".
Some makers have produced cymbals described as splash up to 22", but a splash of 14" or more is more often described as a crash cymbal.
Splash cymbals include:
Traditional splash cymbals, medium in weight with little or no taper.
Rock splash cymbals, heavy but often with a slight taper.
China splash cymbals.
Salsa splash cymbals.
Thin splash cymbals.
Bell cymbals.
Specialised stack cymbals.
