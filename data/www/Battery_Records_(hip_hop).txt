For the former dance/electronic music imprint also under Jive/Zomba, see Battery Records (dance)
Battery Records is a hip-hop label started by Neil Levine under Zomba Label Group, which is currently owned by Sony Music Entertainment. The label was launched mid-2008 by Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The label primarily focuses on new talent, often overseeing early-stage development for acts that are destined for other labels such as J Records or Jive. However, it also serves established artists looking for non-traditional deals, such as releasing Q-Tip's long-awaited solo album Kamaal/The Abstract, which had been shelved nearly seven years prior.
