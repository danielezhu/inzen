Dave Matthews Band, also known by the initialism DMB, is an American rock band that was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991. The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer and backing vocalist Carter Beauford, and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley joined the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident. Grammy Award winner Jeff Coffin (of BÃ©la Fleck and the Flecktones) has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist; trumpeter Rashawn Ross and guitarist Tim Reynolds have also become full-time members of the band. The group's 2009 album Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King, their first after Moore's death, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning them their fifth consecutive number-one debut; their most recent album, 2012's Away from the World, debuted at number one on the Billboard chart, making Dave Matthews Band the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot. As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band has sold over 50 million records worldwide.
The Dave Matthews Band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. The band is known for playing the songs differently each time. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s.A staple of their summer tour is a three day stint at The Gorge Amphitheatre in Washington state over Labor Day weekend.
