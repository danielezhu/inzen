Harmolodics is the musical philosophy and compositional/improvisational method of jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman. It is therefore associated with avant-garde jazz and free jazz, although its implications extend beyond these limits. Coleman's work following this philosophy during the late 1970s and 1980s inspired a style of free-thinking jazz funk known as "harmolodic funk". Coleman also used the name "Harmolodic" for both his first website and his record label.
