"My Favorite Things" is a 1959 song, originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music.
The song was first performed by Maria (played by Mary Martin) and Mother Abbess (Patricia Neway) in the original 1959 Broadway production.
Julie Andrews performed the song for the first time on the Christmas special for The Garry Moore Show in 1961, and then in the 1965 film.
