Miles Davis All Stars, Volume 2 (PRLP 200) is a 10-inch LP album by Miles Davis, released in 1955 by Prestige Records. The two side-long tracks on this LP, and two others, were recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's Studio, Hackensack, New Jersey, on December 24, 1954. This was the second of two 10" LPs sourced from the same session, which featured major be-bop contemporaries Milt Jackson and Thelonious Monk, along with the same rhythm section that had been used on Davis' other recent albums. Jackson, Heath, and Clarke were at the time of recording three-quarters of the Modern Jazz Quartet.
After the 10" LP format was discontinued, both tracks were reissued on the 12" LP Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants (PRLP 7150), along with "Swing Spring" from Volume 1 (PRLP 196), a previously unreleased alternate take of "The Man I Love", from the same session, and an unrelated track from a later session with his First Great Quintet.
This would be the last Miles Davis LP issued by Prestige in the short-lived 10" format. His next album, Musings of Miles (PRLP 7007), would be his first 12" LP, followed by Dig (PRLP 7012), which would be the first to repackage the older 10" material. Alternating albums of new and repackaged material would follow, until all the early Prestige material was now available in the new format.
