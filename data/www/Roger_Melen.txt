Roger Douglas Melen (born 1946) is an electrical engineer recognized for his early contributions to the microcomputer industry, and for his technical innovations.
Dr. Melen was co-founder of Cromemco, one of the earliest microcomputer companies. At Cromemco he developed color graphics systems that were widely used in television broadcast, and in mission planning systems deployed by the United States Air Force. He also developed the first microcomputer systems widely distributed in China. In addition to his work in microcomputer systems and color graphics, Dr. Melen has made significant technical contributions to the development of CCD image sensors, ultrasonic imaging systems, implantable cochlear devices, image processing technology, and vehicular information systems.
He has been recognized as one of the most important inventors and innovators in the history of Silicon Valley.
