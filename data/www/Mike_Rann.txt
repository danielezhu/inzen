**Michael David** " **Mike** " **Rann** AC , CNZM (born 5 January 1953) is a
former Australian politician who was the 44th Premier of South Australia from
2002 to 2011. He accepted a professorship at Flinders University and a
visiting fellowship at University of Auckland in 2012, was Australian High
Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2013 to 2014, and was Australia's
Ambassador to Italy, Albania, Libya and San Marino and as Australia's
Permanent Representative to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture
Organisation and World Food Programme from 2014 to 2016. Among several other
honours, Rann was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) at
Australia Day in 2016.

Rann succeeded Lynn Arnold as leader of the South Australian Branch of the
Australian Labor Party and South Australian Leader of the Opposition in 1994.
Rann led Labor to minority government at the 2002 election, before attaining a
landslide win at the 2006 election. The Rann Government was elected to a third
four-year term at the 2010 election, retaining majority government despite a
swing − giving Labor a record 12 years in government. He resigned as Premier
in October 2011 after a year of poor opinion polling saw him lose party
support and was succeeded by Jay Weatherill. Rann is the third-longest serving
Premier of South Australia behind Thomas Playford IV and John Bannon − the
third-longest serving Leader of the Opposition from 1994 to 2002 behind Mick
O'Halloran and Robert Richards − and served a record 17 years as South
Australian Labor parliamentary leader from 1994 to 2011. He was a South
Australian MP in the House of Assembly from the 1985 election and Father of
the House from the 2010 election until his parliamentary resignation on 13
January 2012.

The Labor government Rann formerly led, through Weatherill, became the
longest-serving South Australian Labor government and the second longest-
serving South Australian government behind the Playmander-assisted Thomas
Playford IV. Aside from Playford, the 2014 election was the second time that
any party has won four consecutive state elections in South Australia, the
first occurred when Don Dunstan led Labor to four consecutive victories
between the 1970 election and the 1977 election. Following the 2014 election,
Labor went from minority to majority government when Nat Cook won the 2014
Fisher by-election by five votes from a 7.3 percent two-party swing.

Achievements of the Rann Government include job numbers raised and
unemployment lowered, funding increased for health and education, the
expansion of mining and defence industries, investment in wind power in South
Australia making it the leader of wind power in Australia, and funding
increased for new projects including: the Adelaide tram extension and new
vehicle purchase, commencement of the rail electrification of Adelaide's train
lines, construction commencement of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital,
redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval, expansion of the Adelaide Convention
Centre, upgrade of the River Torrens Riverbank precinct, construction of the
Port Stanvac Desalination Plant, and the undertaking of various major road
works including major upgrades to the North–South Corridor and South Road,
aiming to be stop-free by 2030 for over 100 km from Old Noarlunga in the outer
southern metropolitan Adelaide suburbs through to Nuriootpa in the inner
northern rural area around the Barossa Valley, such as construction of the
Anzac Highway underpass and construction commencement (now built) of the
elevated North-South Motorway/South Road Superway, construction of the Port
River Expressway and Northern Expressway, the upgrade of the Sturt Highway,
the duplication and expansion of the Southern Expressway and plans for the
construction (now in-progress) of the Northern Connector to join up the
Superway and Expressway. His government also introduced Adelaide's Thinker in
Residence program. South Australia achieved a AAA credit rating under the Rann
Labor government, prompting Business SA chief executive Peter Vaughan to
praise Labor's economic management. Rann was often the most popular Premier in
the country, with his approach to government generally moderate and crisis-
free. Following the 2006 election landslide where Labor was re-elected with a
historic 56.8 percent two-party-preferred vote, Newspoll early in 2007 saw
Rann peak at a historic 64 percent Preferred Premier rating with a historic 61
percent Labor two-party-preferred vote. University of Adelaide Professor of
Politics Clem Macintyre said that after John Bannon and the State Bank
collapse, Rann had to re-establish Labor's credentials as an economic manager
as a matter of urgency, and "in that sense Rann had a whole lot of priorities
to concentrate on that Don Dunstan didn't even think about", with a legacy
built on economic achievements, achieving the triple-A credit rating, as well
as its capacity to deliver infrastructure projects.

## Early life[edit]

Rann was born in Sidcup, England.[1] His father was an electrician who had
served at El Alamein in World War II. His mother was employed in an armaments
factory.[2] Most of Rann's childhood was spent in the care of his father in
South London. In 1962, when he was nine, his family emigrated from Blackfen to
Mangakino, a small town north of Taupo on the Waikato River in New Zealand.
His family then moved to Matamata, then to Birkenhead on Auckland's North
Shore where he attended Northcote College.[3]

He completed a Bachelor and a Master of Arts in political science at the
University of Auckland. He was Vice President of the New Zealand Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament and editor of the student newspaper _Craccum_. As a member
of Princes Street Labour, he also spent considerable time working on New
Zealand Labour Party campaigns including that of Mike Moore. After university,
Rann was a political journalist for the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation.
Haydon Manning has stated that "it was reported that" Rann "struggled with
being an objective reporter".[3]

Rann visited his brother Chris in Adelaide during 1977. Shortly afterwards he
moved to that city, to carry out a position with then Premier Don Dunstan's
Industrial Democracy Unit. He subsequently worked as Dunstan's press
secretary, speech writer and adviser, and went on to serve Labor premiers Des
Corcoran and John Bannon after Dunstan's retirement from politics. Manning has
stated that one commentator reported that Rann was "frankly inspired by
Dunstan's idealism" as opposed to "Bannon's cool electoral pragmatism". Rann
sometimes talked during this period of his ambitions to one day become Premier
himself. Meanwhile, Rann wrote speeches on, and assisted in policy development
for, civil liberties, Aboriginal land rights, gay and women's rights, and
opposition to uranium mining. Revealing a vein of idealism, his early
predilection was left of centre.[3][4]

## Parliament[edit]

Rann was elected to Parliament as the Member for the safe Labor seat of Briggs
in north Adelaide at the 1985 election. After the 1989 election, he entered
the ministry, becoming Minister for Employment and Further Education, Minister
of Youth Affairs, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Minister assisting in
Ethnic Affairs.

As Minister for Employment and Further Education he established the Kickstart
employment scheme, the South Australian Youth Conservation Corps,[5] presided
over a large expansion of TAFE, and signed an agreement in 1992 between Le
Cordon Bleu, the Swiss Hotel Association and the Regency College of TAFE to
establish an international hospitality and cooking school.[6] He introduced
the legislation in 1991 to establish the new University of South Australia,
now the biggest university in the state.[7] As a member of the Australian
Education Council he played a key role in 1992 in the creation of ANTA, the
Australian National Training Authority, with shared funding of TAFE by Federal
as well as state governments. As Minister of Aboriginal Affairs he campaigned
for a clean-up of Maralinga lands affected by the UK nuclear tests in the
1950s and legislated in 1991 to return the sacred Ooldea lands to the
Maralinga Tjarutja people.[8] As Minister of Tourism he legislated in 1993 to
establish the South Australian Tourism Commission and had ministerial
responsibility for the Australian Formula One Grand Prix.[9]

Labor lost government at the 1993 election in a landslide due to the State
Bank collapse, falling to only 10 seats. After the election, Rann was first
elected as Deputy Leader of the Opposition under Lynn Arnold. However, when
Arnold resigned a few months later, Rann succeeded him as Parliamentary Leader
of the Opposition in September 1994. As Opposition Leader Rann launched a
"Labor Listens" strategy designed to re-connect with voters[10] and vigorously
opposed the privatisation of water services and electricity assets. Assisted
by Liberal government leaks he exploited their internal divisions. Following
the ousting of Premier Dean Brown by John Olsen, Rann released a series of
damaging Cabinet documents and was involved in a prolonged and bitter legal
battle with Premier Olsen.

Rann went into the 1997 election as a decided underdog. However, he turned the
campaign into a "referendum on privatisation." Under Rann's leadership, Labor
regained much of what it had lost in its severe defeat of four years earlier.
Labor picked up a massive 9.5 percent swing, still the largest against a
sitting government on record in South Australia. It also more than doubled its
seat count compared to 1993, and actually came within three seats of making
Rann premier. Olsen was forced into a minority government, supported by the
Nationals and independents. After the election the Liberal government reversed
their pre-election commitment, opting to privatise the state's electricity
assets, contributing to the Liberal government's declining poll support.
Following the Motorola affair, Olsen was forced to resign as Premier in late
2001. He was succeeded by his popular deputy Rob Kerin, who was able to
significantly reduce Labor's poll lead.

## Premier[edit]

Rann remained Leader of the Opposition until the 2002 election. The Labor
opposition took two seats from the Liberals. This left Labor one short of
majority government while the Liberals were four seats short. Despite this, it
initially appeared Kerin would remain in office with the support of four
conservative-leaning independents. However, one of those independents, former
Liberal Peter Lewis, agreed to support Labor in return for a constitutional
convention and being named Speaker. On paper, this made Rann premier-elect,
with a majority of one vote. In response, Kerin announced that in accordance
with precedent set by Don Dunstan three decades earlier, he would stay in
office until Labor demonstrated it had support on the floor of the House of
Assembly. He argued that since the Liberals had won a bare majority of the
two-party vote, he still had a mandate to govern. Three weeks of deadlock
ended when the new legislature met for the first time. With Lewis presiding,
Kerin proposed a motion of confidence in his government. The motion failed,
and Kerin's government immediately resigned.[11] Rann then advised Governor
Marjorie Jackson-Nelson that he could form a government, and was duly sworn in
the next day. Rann later secured the support of conservative independent Rory
McEwen and the Nationals' Karlene Maywald by adding them to his cabinet. He
also agreed to back Liberal-turned-independent Bob Such as Speaker after Lewis
retired.

In addition to Premier, Rann also served as the Minister for Economic
Development, Minister for Social Inclusion, Minister for the Arts, and
Minister for Sustainability and Climate Change. Rann was appointed chairman of
a new Australian Federation Council in July 2006, a council which was created
to improve state-federal ties. Rann also ran for national presidency in the
National Executive in August 2006, and made senior-vice president with 27
percent of the vote. As such, he also served a rotation of the Presidency of
the ALP National Executive in 2008.[12]

### Popularity in earlier years[edit]

extension of the Glenelg Tram line in 2007.

stolen generations in 2008.

Rann's earlier achievements included raising job numbers and lowering
unemployment, increasing new project funding, increasing expenditure on
schools, university, health and mental illness, halving rough-sleeping in the
streets, making the state home to the largest amount of wind power in
Australia, developing hot rock power, and utilising solar power for the public
service. South Australia's debt achieved a AAA rating under the Rann Labor
government,[13] prompting Business SA chief executive Peter Vaughan to praise
Labor's economic management.[14] Rann subsidised theatres,[15] added
Guggenheim galleries,[15] introduced the Festival of Ideas[15] and Adelaide's
Thinker in Residence program,[15] and encouraged the idea that film festivals
fund movies.[15] He made WOMAD, the Adelaide Fringe Festival and the Adelaide
Festival of Arts annual.[15]

Rann was comfortably reelected in 2006, taking 28 seats to the Liberals' 15—to
date, Labor's largest majority since the abolition of the Playmander. Labor
also garnered a two-party vote of 56.8 percent, a significant comeback from
its low of 39 percent in 1993 under Arnold.

Rann personally likened his government to Dunstan's, stating "I'm a totally
different person to Don Dunstan, but in the 70s for different reasons South
Australia stood head and shoulders above the crowd. We stood out, we were
leaders. Interestingly, the federal Government is setting up a social
inclusion unit based on ours. Again it's about us not only making a difference
locally, but being a kind of model for others, which is what Dunstan used to
say he wanted us to be ... a laboratory and a leader for the future." Rann
says he expected other reforms to be based upon those enacted under his
government, citing the state's strategic plan, a 10-year framework for the
development of government and business. "It's a plan for the state, not just
promises at each election. A lot of colleagues interstate thought I'd gone mad
when we named targets. Well we didn't want to set targets we could easily pass
and then pat ourselves on the back for, what's the point of that?"[16] A total
of 79 economic and social targets were set,[17] and in 2010 Rann commented
"with most of its targets achieved, on track or within reach".[18] However,
the state's Integrated Design Commissioner, Tim Horton, said in 2011: "Its
targets are really great, but I don't think any of us have signed on to why
those targets exist or what we can do to further them. It's a top-down
approach. I worry the document exists in the minds of agencies but not in the
minds of people."[19]

During Rann's first and second terms, Rann was often the most popular Premier
in the country, with his approach to government generally moderate and crisis-
free.[20] Newspoll early in 2007 saw Rann peak at a historic 64 per cent as
Preferred Premier, and 61 per cent on the two-party-preferred vote. University
of Adelaide Professor of Politics Clem Macintyre said that after the State
Bank collapse, Rann had to re-establish Labor's credentials as an economic
manager as a matter of urgency, and "in that sense Rann had a whole lot of
priorities to concentrate on that Dunstan didn't even think about", with a
legacy built on economic achievements, achieving the triple-A credit rating,
as well as its capacity to deliver infrastructure projects.[21]

Fourth quarter 2007 polling saw a reduction in the strong support for Rann's
Labor government since the previous election, on 54 percent of the two-party-
preferred vote, a fall from the previous poll of five percent. Rann's
Preferred Premier rating was at 50 percent compared to 25 percent for then
Liberal leader Martin Hamilton-Smith.[22][23] Third quarter 2008 polling saw a
more pronounced drop in the primary vote, down three to 38 percent, with the
Liberal vote up five to 40 percent, breaking to a two-party vote of 50–50
after preferences – the Preferred Premier figure recorded a six-point drop to
48 percent for Rann and up three to 30 percent for Hamilton-Smith. Some
commentators put the poll slump down to "labour movement ructions" over the
underfunded WorkCover liability (see 2008 Parnell–Bressington filibuster),
consolidation of rural health services, and the continued degradation of the
River Murray.[24][25]

Newspoll saw Labor back in a winning position on 54 to 46 in late 2008, and
then 56 to 44 in early 2009 along with increases in the Preferred Premier
rating. Polling taken from The Sunday Mail during the 50-50 polling suggested
that whilst there had been large swings away from the government in country
areas, polling held relatively firm at 2006 election levels in the
metropolitan areas.[26]

The 2009 Frome by-election saw Labor pick up a small increase in the two-
party-preferred vote. This, coupled with the "dodgy documents affair", also
known as "dodgy-gate"[ _citation needed_ ], saw Hamilton-Smith step down from
the Liberal leadership, to be replaced by Isobel Redmond.

### Affair allegations[edit]

On 22 November 2009, Seven Network's _Sunday Night_ current affairs program
aired a paid television interview alleging that Rann had an affair with a
Parliament House waitress between March 2004 and October 2005.[27][28]

Rann commented before the interview went to air that claims of a sexual
relationship were "wildly sensational", and that once he had seen the program,
he would respond with a "brief statement".[29][30] He also expressed
frustration that he had been unable to "clear the air" because matters were
before a court.[31] The day after the allegations were aired, Rann called a
press conference where he explicitly denied the allegations made in the
interview, claimed the program was outrageous, and stated the claims were
malicious lies aimed at damaging him politically and personally.[32]

An out-of-court settlement was paid by Seven Network to Rann in February 2010
and with an apology issued for suggesting the affair had an effect on Rann
discharging his duties as Premier of South Australia.[33] Polling was
conducted by _The Advertiser_ in December 2009 with answers to questions
revealing little voter interest in the allegations.[34][35] Others suggested
that it was the turning point for Rann's decline, with the issue causing
indirect damage over a sustained period of time.[36][37]

###  Third term[edit]

The Rann Labor government won a third four-year term at the 2010 state
election with 26 of 47 seats though with only 48.4 percent of the two-party
preferred vote. It was the first Rann Labor election campaign that took to
YouTube and social networking.[38] As Labor held government until the 2014
state election, with four-year terms, it is the longest-serving period of a
South Australian Labor government in history. Rann also served as Labor leader
since 1994, a record period as Labor leader.

New and continued projects for Rann Labor's third term were claimed to be the
biggest infrastructure spend in the state's history, which included rail
electrification of Adelaide's train lines, expansion of the Adelaide tram
line, construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Adelaide Oval
redevelopment, expansion of the Adelaide Convention Centre, redesigning the
River Torrens Riverbank precinct, expanding mining and defence industries, the
Port Stanvac Desalination Plant, and continued various major road works
including various upgrades to the North–South Corridor.[39]

Public sector budget cuts due to decreased tax receipts stemming from the
global financial crisis introduced after the 2010 election caused protest
amongst unionists and other traditional Labor voters. Rann defeated a motion
against his leadership at the yearly Labor convention in 2010.[40][41]

In early 2011 Rann reshuffled his cabinet after Deputy Premier and Treasurer
Kevin Foley resigned from both positions but remained in the cabinet.
Attorney-General John Rau became Deputy Premier and Jack Snelling became
Treasurer.[42]

The first Newspoll of the third term of the Rann Labor government in March
2011 showed Rann's personal satisfaction-dissatisfaction rating at a new low
of 30–59 and a two-party vote of 44–56, a swing against Labor of 4.4 percent
since the 2010 election. Labor's primary vote dived to 29 percent, down 8.5
percent, the Liberal vote remained at 42 percent, whilst the Greens surged to
14 percent, an increase of 6 percent, with "other" slightly higher. The
subsequent Newspoll saw the two-party vote narrow to 46–54, a swing against
Labor of just 2.4 percent, however there was no statistical change in Rann's
personal satisfaction-dissatisfaction ratings.

In late July 2011, the _Australian Broadcasting Corporation_ (ABC) and _The
Advertiser_ reported that senior figures within Labor had indicated to Rann
that the state party's left and right factions had formally decided to replace
Rann with Education Minister Jay Weatherill as party leader. A day later, Rann
confirmed he would stand down and undergo a party leadership transition to
Weatherill, with the handover occurring in October 2011.[43][44][45][46][47]

Rann formally resigned from the premiership on 21 October 2011, and Weatherill
was elected unopposed as his successor.[48]

Rann resigned from parliament on 13 January 2012 which created an 11 February
2012 Ramsay by-election. Zoe Bettison easily retained the seat for Labor with
only a slight swing against her, and Ramsay remained the safest of Labor's
lower house seats.[49][50][51]

## Post-parliamentary career[edit]

Stock Exchange in 2014.

Rann's post-parliamentary appointments include the new Urban Policy Forum
created by the federal government, as a professor in the School of Social and
Policy Studies with Flinders University and as a visiting fellowship in
political studies at the University of Auckland. He has also joined the
International Leadership Council of The Climate Group, and the International
Advisory Board of the Ecological Sequestration Trust.[52][53][54] Rann was
also appointed Adjunct Professor in Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon
University, Fellow for Democracy and Development at the Washington, D.C.-based
Center for National Policy and as Member of the Council of the Royal
Institution Australia.[55]

Rann was appointed Chair of Low Carbon Australia Pty Ltd in early 2012, the
federal government's "green bank" providing finance to companies to reduce
carbon emissions[56] and to the International Leadership Council of The
Climate Group.[57]

Rann was announced on 23 August 2012 as the next Australian High Commissioner
to the United Kingdom.[58][59][60] Rann also assumed the role of Permanent
Representative to the United Nations International Maritime Organisation,
Commonwealth War Graves Commissioner and Trustee of the Imperial War
Museum.[55] Mike Rann is currently Australia's Ambassador to Italy, San
Marino, Albania and Libya. He is also Australia's Permanent Representative to
the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food
Programme.

## Personal life[edit]

Rann was married to Jenny Russell until the late 1990s and had two children
with her, David and Eleanor. On 15 July 2006, he married his second wife,
actress Sasha Carruozzo.[3] It was revealed in December 2011 that she is
undergoing treatment for breast cancer.[61]

In 2016, Rann's son, David, was appointed media advisor to South Australian
Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis.[62]
