Charlie Rose is an American television interview show, with Charlie Rose as executive producer, executive editor, and host. The show is syndicated on PBS and is owned by Charlie Rose, Inc. Rose interviews thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers.
The show premiered on September 30, 1991. It is presented by WNET, where it first aired as a local program. The program is additionally broadcast by Bloomberg Television with a week delay, which provides the show's recording facility. The set is simple, set up with an all-dark surrounding space around an oak round table used since the program debuted and purchased by Rose himself, along with accompanying chairs.
Funding for the show is primarily provided by donations from various corporations and charitable foundations. The show has been criticized for not disclosing the list of donors even if the show is considered "public" broadcasting.
In 2010, Rose and co-host Eric Kandel began "The Brain Series", episodes featuring neuroscientists and other experts; the series was later released on DVD.
In October 2014, a segment called "Al Hunt on the Story" was launched as a "regular feature interview"; Hunt's first interview under this banner was with Secretary of State John Kerry.
The show is filmed at 731 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. This is the same building which houses Bloomberg Television, and Bloomberg L.P. which sponsors the show.
In February 2017, the show utilized a number of guest hosts while Rose underwent heart surgery. Afterwards, Rose stated a planned return in March.
