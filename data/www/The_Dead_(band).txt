The Dead was an American rock band composed of some of the former members of the Grateful Dead.
After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann formed a band called The Other Ones. They performed concert tours in 1998 (without Kreutzmann), 2000 (without Lesh), and 2002, and released one album, The Strange Remain. In 2003, they changed their name to The Dead.
