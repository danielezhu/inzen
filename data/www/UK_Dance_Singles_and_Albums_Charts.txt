The UK Dance Singles Chart and the UK Dance Albums Chart are music charts compiled in the United Kingdom by the Official Charts Company from sales of songs in the dance music genre (e.g. house, trance, drum and bass, synthpop) in record stores and digital downloads. The actual chart currently receives airplay on MTV Dance, and the chart can be viewed on the BBC Radio 1's and Official Charts Company's website. The archive on the Official Charts Company website goes back to 3 July 1994.
Digital downloads became eligible on the Dance Album and Singles Chart in June 2009. Prior to that, only vinyl and CD sales only were compiled into the chart.
The Dance Singles and Album Charts contain 40 positions.
