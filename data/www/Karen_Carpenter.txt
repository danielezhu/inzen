Karen Anne Carpenter (March 2, 1950 â€“ February 4, 1983) was an American singer and drummer. She and her brother Richard Carpenter formed the 1970s duo The Carpenters. Her skills as a drummer earned admiration from drumming luminaries and peers, but she is best known for her vocal performances. She typically sang in a contralto vocal range.
Carpenter suffered from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that was little known at the time. She died at age 32 from heart failure caused by complications related to her illness. Carpenter's death led to increased visibility and awareness of eating disorders.
