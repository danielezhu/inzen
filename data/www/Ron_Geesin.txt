Ronald Frederick Geesin (born 17 December 1943, in Stevenston, Ayrshire, Scotland) is a Scottish musician and composer, noted for his quirky creations and novel applications of sound. Geesin is well known for his collaborations with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters. After the band found themselves hopelessly deadlocked over how to complete the title track from Atom Heart Mother in 1970, he worked with Pink Floyd as an orchestrator and organizer, and he also wrote the brass introduction. Geesin also collaborated with the band's Roger Waters (the two men shared a love of golf) on the unconventional film soundtrack Music from "The Body" (1970), sampling sounds made by the human body. Ron Geesin played piano with The Downtown Syncopators, a Dixieland band emulating the 'Original Dixieland Band' during the 1960s. The band was based in or near Crawley, Sussex, UK.
