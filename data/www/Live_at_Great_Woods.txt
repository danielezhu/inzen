Live at Great Woods is a concert video by the Allman Brothers Band. It was recorded on September 6, 1991, at Great Woods Amphitheater in Mansfield, Massachusetts. It was released on DVD by Legacy Recordings on February 18, 2014.
Live at Great Woods was originally produced for Japanese TV, and was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1992. Subsequently a version of the video was released on DVD, but in a shortened form, with interviews of the band members edited into the song performances. The 2014 version of the DVD omits the interviews and contains the complete performances of the songs.
