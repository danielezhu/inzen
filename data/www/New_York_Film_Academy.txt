New York Film Academy â€“ School of Film and Acting (NYFA) is a for-profit film school and acting school based in New York City, Los Angeles, and across the world. The New York Film Academy was founded in 1992 by Jerry Sherlock, a former film, television and theatre producer. It was originally located at the Tribeca Film Center. In 1994, NYFA moved to the former Tammany Hall building in Union Square. After 23 years of occupancy, the Academy relocated from Tammany Hall to Battery Park in October 2015.
As of 2012, the school has 400+ employees and over 7,000 students per year. NYFA offers master, bachelor, and associate degrees, as well as one- and two-year conservatory programs, short-term workshops, and youth programs and summer camps in filmmaking, acting for film, photography, fashion photography, documentary filmmaking, 3D animation & visual effects, game design, producing, screenwriting, digital filmmaking, cinematography, broadcast journalism, musical theatre, music video, digital editing, graphic design, virtual reality, and ESL at various locations throughout the world.
The New York Film Academy's philosophy is based on a "learning by doing" approach. NYFA founder Jerry Sherlock explained to the New York Times in 2005 that he opened the school after hearing interest from parents and older relatives of aspiring young filmmakers, and that he wanted to focus on practical experience.
