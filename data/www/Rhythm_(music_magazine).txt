In August 2010 Rhythm launched an online poll to find the Greatest Drummer of the Last 25 Years. After more than 100,000 votes, Slipknot’s Joey Jordison was crowned as the winner, having taken more than 38,000 of the votes. In response to the award, Jordison told Rhythm: “This is bigger than a Grammy to me! You people keep me alive, I can't thank all of you enough. To all the Rhythm staff, thank you, you are amazing! Thank you to my family, friends, all the amazing drummers I was in company with, without them I wouldn't be here either and last but not least, all my brothers in Slipknot! Thank you all again!"
Rhythm celebrated its 25th anniversary in its September 2010 issue. The issue included birthday messages from drummers including Nick Mason, Chad Smith, Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Terry Bozzio, Stewart Copeland, Vinnie Colaiuta, Neil Peart and Nicko McBrain.
