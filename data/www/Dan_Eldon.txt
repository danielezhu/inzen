Daniel Robert "Dan" Eldon (18 September 1970 â€“ 12 July 1993) was a Kenyan photojournalist, artist and activist. He and three colleagues were stoned to death in Mogadishu in an incident before the Battle of Mogadishu. He left behind a series of journals, which Chronicle Books have used to publish three books, "The Journey is the Destination", "Dan Eldon, the Art of Life" and "Safari as a Way of Life".
