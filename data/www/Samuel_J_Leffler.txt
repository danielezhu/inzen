Samuel J Leffler is a computer scientist, known for his extensive work on BSD, from the 1980s to FreeBSD in the present day. Among other projects, he created FlexFAX, libtiff, and the FreeBSD Wireless Device Drivers.
The Design and Implementation series of books, which he co-authored, are regarded as very high quality works in computer science. They have been strongly influential in the development of the BSD descendants and have contributed to their cohesive and well-thought-out nature.
While working for the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Leffler helped with 4.1 and 4.2 BSD release. He has contributed to almost every aspect of BSD systems, including the networking subsystem. After leaving Computer Systems Research Group, Mr. Leffler also worked at Lucasfilm, Pixar, Silicon Graphics, and VMware. Later he became an independent consultant on system design.
