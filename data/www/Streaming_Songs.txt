The Streaming Songs chart is released weekly by Billboard magazine and lists each week's top streamed radio songs, on-demand songs and videos on leading online music services in the United States. The chart represents one of the three components, along with airplay (Hot 100 Airplay) and sales (Hot Digital Songs and Hot Singles Sales), that determine the chart positions of songs on the Billboard Hot 100, which ranks the most popular songs in the United States.
Billboard editorial director Bill Werde said that "Harlem Shake"'s success prompted them to enact the chart policy after two years of discussions with YouTube". The first number-one song on the chart was "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Wanz on January 19, 2013.
