"True Love" is a popular song written by Cole Porter and was published in 1956. The song was introduced by Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in the musical film High Society. "True Love" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song. The Crosbyâ€“Kelly version, accompanied by Johnny Green's MGM studio orchestra using a romantic arrangement by Conrad Salinger, was a hit single, peaking No. 4 in the United States and No. 4 in the UK. A 1983 re-issue reached No. 70 in the UK.
Kelly's contribution on the record is relatively minor, duetting with Crosby on only the final chorus. Nonetheless, the single is co-credited to her and became her only gold record. It was Crosby's 21st gold record.
"True Love" is the name of a yacht on which two of the characters honeymoon in the play The Philadelphia Story, on which the musical is based. Bing Crosby later owned a 55-foot Constellation yacht which he named the "True Love".
