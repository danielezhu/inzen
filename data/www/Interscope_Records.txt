Interscope Records is an American record label. An imprint of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, its parent company is Universal Music Group, a subsidiary of Vivendi S.A.
Interscope was founded in 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Warner Music Group's Atlantic Records. At the time, it differed from most record companies by giving decision-making authority to its A&R staff, and allowing artists and producers complete creative control. It had its first hit records less than a year after it was founded and achieved profitability in 1993.  Iovine served as chairman and CEO until May 2014, when he was succeeded by John Janick.
In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute the hardcore rap label Death Row Records, whose artists included rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg, at the center of the mid-'90s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, the former owner of WMG, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired by the MCA Music Entertainment Group for a reported $200 million.
Interscope is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. The label's best-selling artists include Eminem, U2, and Lady Gaga.
