GHV2 (an abbreviation of Greatest Hits Volume 2) is the second greatest hits album by American recording artist Madonna. Maverick and Warner Bros. Records released it on November 12, 2001, coinciding with the video album, Drowned World Tour 2001. A follow-up to The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 contains a collection of singles during the second decade of Madonna's career. Madonna mentioned that she only included "songs that I could listen to five times in a row" on it. The album did not contain any new songs, but a promotional single, "GHV2 Megamix", was released to promote it, with remixes by Thunderpuss, John Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young. Another promotional remix album was released alongside, titled GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991â€“2001.
GHV2 received generally positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it as an essential compilation, although some criticized the absence of new material. Commercially, the compilation was successful, peaking at number seven on the US Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, GHV2 also attained success, reaching the top five in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and several other European countries. It was the 14th best-selling album of the year and has sold more than seven million units worldwide.
