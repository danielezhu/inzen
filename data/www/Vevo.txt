Vevo (; VEE-voh) is an American multinational video hosting service founded on December 8, 2009 as a joint venture between two of the "big three" record companies, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is based in New York City and its shareholders now consist of both UMG and SME as well as Abu Dhabi Media and Google after it took a 7% share in 2013, with the third "big three" company, Warner Music Group (WMG) joining Vevo in August 2016.
Vevo hosts music videos from both Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment syndicated on YouTube and its website, with Google and Vevo sharing advertising and similar benefits. EMI also licensed its library of videos for Vevo shortly before its launch and its acquisition by UMG in 2012. Originally, Warner Music Group was reported to be considering hosting its content on the service after it launched, but formed an alliance with rival MTV Networks (now Viacom Media Networks). In August 2015, Vevo expressed renewed interest in licensing music from Warner Music Group, and its deal with WMG was completed on August 2, 2016, making the entirety of the "big three" record companies' music eligible for licensing for Vevo.
