A caesura ( or , pl. caesuras or caesurae; Latin for "cutting"), also written c√¶sura and cesura, is a break in a verse where one phrase ends and the following phrase begins. In time value this break may vary between the slightest perception of silence all the way up to a full pause. A caesura in music represents a similar break or pause. The length of a caesura where notated is at the discretion of the conductor. In choral works a brief caesura may be notated where singers are to catch their breath.
