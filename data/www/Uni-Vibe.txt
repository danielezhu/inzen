The Uni-Vibe (or UniVibe), also known as Jax Vibra-Chorus, is a footpedal-operated phaser or phase shifter for creating chorus and vibrato simulations for electric organ or guitar. Designed by audio engineer Fumio Mieda, it was introduced in the 1960s by Japanese company Shin-ei, and then released in North America by Univox in 1968.
It was intended to emulate the "Doppler sound" of a Leslie speaker. Though not very successful as a Leslie simulator, the Uni-Vibe became an effect in its own right, putting its stamp on tracks like Robin Trower's "Bridge of Sighs", Jimi Hendrix's "Machine Gun" and Pink Floyd's "Breathe".
