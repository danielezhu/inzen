Noah Adams is an American broadcast journalist and author, known primarily for his more than thirty years of experience on National Public Radio. A former co-host of the daily All Things Considered program, he is currently the contributing correspondent at the network's National Desk. As a bestselling author, Adams' books tend to document a full year in his life, specifically as that year relates to a particular passion or research project. Adams has also dabbled in major documentary projects, such as Father Cares: The Last of Jonestown in 1981. The program, which he wrote and narrated, earned him the Prix Italia, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, and the Major Armstrong Award.
Adams was the host of the nationally syndicated Minnesota Public Radio variety show Good Evening, created in 1987 to replace A Prairie Home Companion after that show left the air.  Good Evening ran for less than a year before being canceled; A Prairie Home Companion returned after a several-year hiatus.
Adams was born in Ashland, Kentucky. He is married to Neenah Ellis, public radio producer and general manager of WYSO-FM in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where they both make their home.
