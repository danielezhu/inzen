Amsterdam Concert is a rare live Miles Davis recording from 1957. This album, one of the least-known recordings of Miles Davis, was recorded at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam on December 8, 1957, a couple of days after the recording of the movie soundtrack Ascenseur pour l'échafaud. On this concert, Miles did not play with his regular quintet, but with the same line-up he used for the recording of Ascenseur pour l'échafaud. It features Barney Wilen on tenor saxophone, René Urtreger on piano, Pierre Michelot on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.
