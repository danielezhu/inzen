A namesake is a person named after another. Namesake may also refer to a thing, such as a company, place, ship, building, or concept, named after a person.
In general, the second recipient of a name, named for the first, is said to be the namesake of the first. The attribution can, however, go in the opposite direction, with namesake referring to the original holder of the name (the eponym).
The word is first recorded in the mid-seventeenth century, and probably comes from the phrase "for [the, my, his, her] name's sake".
