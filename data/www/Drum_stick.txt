A drumstick is a type of percussion mallet used particularly for playing snare drum, drum kit and some other percussion instruments, and particularly for playing unpitched percussion.
Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments, such as the metal beater or wand used with a triangle, and particularly beaters or mallets used with tuned percussion such as xylophone and timpani, are not normally referred to as drumsticks. Drumsticks generally have all of the following characteristics:
They are normally supplied and used in pairs.
They are held in the hands, most often one in each hand.
They may be used to play at least some sort of drum (as well as other instruments).
They are normally used only for untuned percussion.
