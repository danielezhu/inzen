Cantopop (traditional Chinese: 粵語流行音樂; simplified Chinese: 粤语流行音乐, a contraction of "Cantonese pop music") or HK-pop (short for "Hong Kong pop music") is a genre of Cantonese music made primarily in Hong Kong, and also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. Originating in the 1970s, Cantopop reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before its slow decline in the 2000s. The term "Cantopop" itself was coined in 1978 after "Cantorock", a term first used in 1974. During its height, Cantopop had spread to China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Cantopop is influenced by international styles, including jazz, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, electronic music, Western pop music and others. Cantopop songs are almost invariably performed in Cantonese. Boasting a multinational fanbase in Southeast Asian nations such as Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi in mainland China, Hong Kong remains the most significant hub of the genre. The most significant figures in the Cantopop industry include Paula Tsui, Teresa Teng, Samuel Hui, George Lam, Alan Tam, Sally Yeh, Roman Tam, Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung, Beyond, Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, Aaron Kwok, Leon Lai, Sammi Cheng, Faye Wong, Kelly Chen, Eason Chan and Joey Yung.
