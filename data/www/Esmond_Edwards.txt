Esmond Edwards (October 29, 1927 â€“ January 20, 2007) was an American photographer, record producer, and recording engineer. He worked for jazz label Prestige Records during the 1950s and early-1960s. He was originally hired by founder Bob Weinstock as a photographer for the record label. He was a trail-blazing African-American, as very few recording industry executives were from minorities. He took over the supervision of recording sessions as the Prestige label's success grew.
