Dianne Reeves (Detroit, October 23, 1956) is a Grammy-winning jazz singer. Commentator Scott Yanow said of her, "A logical successor to Dinah Washington and Carmen McRae (although even she cannot reach the impossible heights of Ella and Sarah Vaughan), Reeves is a superior interpreter of lyrics and a skilled scat singer."
