HuffPost (formerly The Huffington Post and sometimes abbreviated HuffPo) is a politically liberal American news and opinion website that has both localized and international editions founded by Arianna Huffington, Kenneth Lerer, Jonah Peretti, and Andrew Breitbart, The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women's interests, and local news.
The Huffington Post was launched on May 9, 2005, as a liberal-left commentary outlet/blog and alternative to news aggregators such as the Drudge Report, and it continues to maintain a politically liberal stance. On February 7, 2011, AOL acquired the Huffington Post for US$315 million, making Arianna Huffington editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group.
In July 2012, The Huffington Post was ranked No. 1 on the 15 Most Popular Political Sites list by eBizMBA Rank, which bases its list on each site's Alexa Global Traffic Rank and U.S. Traffic Rank from both Compete and Quantcast. In 2012, The Huffington Post became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.
