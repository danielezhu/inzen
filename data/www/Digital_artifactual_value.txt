Digital artifactual value is a preservation term that refers to the intrinsic value of a digital object, rather than the informational content of the object. There are currently no established standards for what constitutes digital artifactual value. Nonetheless, born-digital objects and digital representations of physical objects may have a value attributed to them as artifacts.
