Kisstory is a UK radio station, a sister station to Kiss that plays "old skool and anthems". Kisstory was initially a radio programme airing between 11am and 12pm Monday–Sunday. Then on 7 May 2013 Kisstory was expanded into a full-time station in response to positive feedback from listeners and at the expense of Q Radio. At the same time KissFresh, a then brand-new station playing "non-stop new beats including Hip-Hop, R&B, EDM, House and Garage", was given its own station.
Said Bauer Radio London managing director Steve Parkinson: "Kiss was born as a dance radio station at a time when genres were very specific but fast forward to the present day and the evolution of music is so wide that one Kiss station alone cannot deliver everything. It’s the right time to launch KissFresh, Kisstory and a new KissKube app as brilliant new additions to the Kiss brand. We’re giving audiences more of what they want whilst attracting new audiences and commercial partners with what we know are fantastic music and content formats."
Andy Roberts, the group programming director, added: "These new launches see Kiss grow through its love for the old and desire for the new. KissFresh will highlight the unknown and known, whilst Kisstory will bring you timeless tunes celebrating memories of good times, the places and people you hung out with and the music you shared with your mates. Kisstory tunes are the DNA that built the Kiss we know today and they’re the tunes Kiss made famous. We really excited to launch these two stand-alone digital stations that allow listeners the opportunity to consume whenever and however they want."
