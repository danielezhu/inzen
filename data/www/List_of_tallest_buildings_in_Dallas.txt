Dallas, the 3rd-most populous city in the U.S. state of Texas, is home to 262 high-rises, 28 of which stand taller than 400 feet (122 m). The tallest building in the city is the 72-story Bank of America Plaza, which rises 921 feet (281 m) in Downtown Dallas and was completed in 1985. The skyscraper, one of the first in the United States to receive the Energy Star Award for efficiency, also stands as the 3rd-tallest building in Texas and the 22nd-tallest building in the nation. The second-tallest building in Dallas is the Renaissance Tower, which rises 56 floors and 886 feet (270 m). Overall, of the ten tallest buildings in Texas, three are located in Dallas; the other seven are all in Houston.
The history of skyscrapers in Dallas began with the construction of the Praetorian Building in 1909, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city, the Southwestern United States and sometimes the entire Western United States. Dallas later went through a construction boom from the early 1970s through the late 1980s, resulting in the construction of over 20 skyscrapers, including the Bank of America Plaza and the Renaissance Tower. Overall, Dallas is the site of 19 skyscrapers that rise at least 500 feet (152 m) in height. As of 2013, the city's skyline is ranked second in Texas (behind Houston), 12th in the United States and 43rd in the world with 41 buildings rising at least 330 feet (100 m) in height.
From the completion of the Cityplace Center in 1988 until the construction of W Dallas Victory Hotel & Residences in 2006, the city was the site of no major skyscraper construction projects; since the mid-2000s, however, the city has seen several prominent proposals for new high-rise developments. One such proposal was the Victory Tower, which, at 650 feet (198 m), would have stood as the tallest building in the new Victory Park neighborhood and housed a new Mandarin Oriental hotel; the project was ultimately canceled. The 560-foot (170 m) Museum Tower is the most recently completed high-rise in the city. Completed in 2012, the building is located in Dallas' Arts District and now stands as the second-tallest all-residential skyscraper in the city, behind Republic Center Tower I. Overall, as of February 2013, there were 26 high-rise buildings under construction or proposed for construction in Dallas.
