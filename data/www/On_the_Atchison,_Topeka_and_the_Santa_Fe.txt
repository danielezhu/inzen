"On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe" is a popular song which refers to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF). It was featured in the 1946 film, The Harvey Girls, where it was sung by Judy Garland, with support from Ben Carter, Marjorie Main, Virginia O'Brien, Ray Bolger, and the MGM Chorus. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song that year.
The music was written by Harry Warren, and the lyrics by Johnny Mercer.  The song was published in 1944, but the most popular recordings were made the following year.
Charting versions were recorded by Mercer, Bing Crosby, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, and Judy Garland and the Merry Macs.
Despite mentions in the lyrics of the song, the actual AT&SF never reached Laramie, Wyoming, or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania without using partner services of through sleepers with other railroads like the Baltimore & Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad.
