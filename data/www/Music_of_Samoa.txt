Traditional Samoan musical instruments included a fala, which is a rolled-up mat beaten with sticks. It is an idiophone which often accompanied choral singing. Another idiophone, a soundingboard, sometimes accompanied the solo recitation of poetry. A conch shell was blown for signaling. Amusement for small groups and individuals in private was afforded by a jaw harp, a raft panpipe, and a nose-blown flute. In recent times it is not uncommon to see the use of Pātē, a hollowed out slit drum which was introduced by Cook Islands missionaries visiting Sāmoa. It usually replaces the Fala and is played in the same rhythmic patterns.
A musical or theatrical presentation celebrating a special event in which performance groups alternate in an attempt to outdo each other's efforts has come to be called a fiafia. It is often a hotel performance, in which dances now called siva Samoa and sasa are performed.
