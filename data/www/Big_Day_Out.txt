The Big Day Out was an annual music festival that was held in five Australian cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Perth, as well as Auckland, New Zealand. The festival was held during summer, typically in January of each year.
The Big Day Out debuted on the 1992 Australia Day public holiday in Sydney and expanded to Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth the following year. The Gold Coast and Auckland were added to the schedule in 1994. As of 2003, it featured seven or eight stages (depending on the venue), accommodating popular contemporary rock music, electronic music, mainstream international acts and local acts.
In early June 2014, American festival promoter, C3 Presents, attained full ownership of the Big Day Out festival and announced the cancellation of the 2015 event on 26 June 2014â€”the option for the festival to return in the future was left open. The event also did not return in 2016 or 2017.
