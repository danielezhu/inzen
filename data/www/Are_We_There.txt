Are We There is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten, released on May 14, 2014.
On the lack of a question mark in the title, Van Etten said: "â€¦ open-ended, I ask myself that question all the time, for my work, for my love, even for my friends. It's just really good to check in with yourself and it's a play on words, about touring and about travelling, being in transition."
