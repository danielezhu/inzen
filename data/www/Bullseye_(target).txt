The bullseye, or bull's-eye, is the centre of a shooting target, and by extension the name given to any shot that hits the bullseye. By extension, the word bullseye can refer to any design or pattern featuring prominent concentric circles, visually suggesting an archery target, and "hitting the bullseye" is a term for an unexpectedly good success.
In some archery traditions the term "Gold" is used in preference to "bullseye". Hitting the most central ring of an international target is worth 10 points, or an Imperial target 9 points in target archery.
In darts it is 5 foot 8 inches (1.73m) above the floor. Before the start of a match players usually throw closest to the bull to decide who has the advantage of throwing first. An inner bullseye (sometimes referred to as a "double bullseye") is a smaller, inner circle and counts for 50 points while an outer bull is worth 25 points. Two treble 20's when combined with an inner bullseye is worth 170 points in darts which is the highest possible checkout. In the World Grand Prix, which has a double start format, an inner bullseye can begin a leg. In the dart golf game Dolf, the bullseye is used as part of a three part tie breaker that also includes the treble twenty.
Hitting three bullseyes in darts is known as the "Alan Evans shot". So far 3 televised nine dart finishes have included a double bullseye.
