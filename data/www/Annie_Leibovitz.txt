Anna-Lou "Annie" Leibovitz (; born October 2, 1949) is an American portrait photographer. She photographed John Lennon on the day he was assassinated, and her work was used on two record albums by Joan Armatrading. She is the first woman to have held an exhibition at Washington's National Portrait Gallery in 1991.
Leibovitz is much influenced by Richard Avedon, and his 'personal reportage', developing close rapport with her subjects.
