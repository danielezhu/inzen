The Eastside, in the context of the King County, Washington, United States area, is a collective term for the suburbs of Seattle located on the east side of Lake Washington. In this context, Westside is synonymous with Seattle. In Washington State more broadly, the term Eastside refers to the part of the state east of the passes over the Cascade Mountains, which can be a source of confusion since all of King County lies to the west of the Cascades.
The most common definitions of the Eastside include the cities of Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Sammamish, Issaquah, Newcastle, and Mercer Island.
The towns west of Bellevue, collectively known as the Gold Coast, are usually considered part of the Eastside. These include Beaux Arts Village, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina, and Yarrow Point.
The Northshore cities of Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville may be considered part of the Eastside, as each city contains portions that are east of the lake and south of its northernmost tip. Similarly, on the southeast tip of Lake Washington, Renton may also be included.
The most expansive definitions of the Eastside can include cities in the Snoqualmie Valley, including Duvall, Carnation, Fall City, Snoqualmie, and North Bend.
In politics, the area is sometimes referred to as the "suburban crescent".
