Circle 7 Animation, or Disney Circle 7 Animation, was a short-lived division of Walt Disney Feature Animation specializing in computer generated imagery (CGI) animation and was originally intended to create sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties, leading rivals and animators to derisively nickname the division "Pixaren't". The studio did not release any films during its existence and none of its scripts were used by Pixar.
The division was named after the street where its studio was located. Circle Seven Drive in Glendale, California is also home to KABC-TV.
