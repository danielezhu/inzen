Scott Miller (April 4, 1960 â€“ April 15, 2013) was a singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as leader of the 1980s band Game Theory and 1990s band The Loud Family, and as the author of a 2010 book of music criticism. He was described by the New York Times as "a hyperintellectual singer and songwriter who liked to tinker with pop the way a born mathematician tinkers with numbers", having "a shimmery-sweet pop sensibility, in the tradition of Brian Wilson and Alex Chilton."
In 2014, Omnivore Recordings began releasing a series of reissues of Miller's entire Game Theory catalog, which had for decades been out of print. A biography of Miller by Brett Milano was published in October 2015, and Miller's posthumously completed Game Theory album, Supercalifragile, is expected in early 2017.
