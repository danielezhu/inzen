The following is a list of Turing Award laureates since 1966 (total 64 winners), grouped by their current and past affiliation to academic institutions. The university affiliations of Turing Award winners fall into three categories in this list: Graduate and Attendee (excluding honorary degrees and auditors), Long-term Academic Staff, and Short-term Academic Staff. The category of "Long-term Academic Staff" mostly consists of tenure/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of "Short-term Academic Staff" mostly consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers, visiting professors/scholars, and equivalent academic positions. Only those universities with at least 5 affiliations of awardees are shown explicitly with ranking.
The number following a person's name is the year he/she received the Turing Award; in particular, a number with asterisk (*) means the person received the award while he/she was working at the institution containing that asterisk. A laureate with his/her name underlined implies that this person has already been counted for a same institution in previous category. If a person had multiple positions under one category, only the position with highest rank is considered.
This list, together with List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation and List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation, presents the university affiliation (with similar criteria) of people who have won highest honors in fundamental academic disciplines.
