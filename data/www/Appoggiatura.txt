An appoggiatura (; Italian: [appoddʒaˈtuːra]; German Vorschlag, Vorhalt; French Port de voix) is a musical ornament that consists of an added note in a melody that is resolved, delaying the appearance of the principal note. The added unessential note is typically one degree higher or lower than the principal note; and if lower, it may be chromatically raised.
The term comes from the Italian verb appoggiare, "to lean upon". It is also called a long appoggiatura to distinguish it from the short appoggiatura, the acciaccatura. An ascending appoggiatura was previously known as a forefall, while a descending appoggiatura was known as a backfall.
In contrast to the acciaccatura, the appoggiatura is important melodically and often suspends the principal note by taking away the time-value of the appoggiatura prefixed to it. The time subtracted is generally half the time value of the principal note, though in simple triple or compound meters, for example, it might receive two thirds of the time.
Appoggiaturas are usually, but not exclusively, on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution and are approached by a leap and left by step. This notation has also been used to mark an accent in the articulation of vocal music, meaning that the grace note should be emphasized, for example in Haydn's Missa Brevis in G major, fifth bar for soprano and tenor voices.
