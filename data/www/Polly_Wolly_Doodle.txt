"Polly Wolly Doodle" is a song first published in a Harvard student songbook in 1880, but is probably older. It was sung by Dan Emmett's Virginia Minstrels, who premiered at New York's Bowery Amphitheatre in February 1843.
"Polly Wolly Doodle" appears in the existing manuscript for Laura Ingalls Wilder's These Happy Golden Years exactly as it is used in the published version. It is sometimes credited to Dan Emmett (1815â€“1904). The melody of this song as it is usually sung formed the basis for Boney M.'s hit Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday in 1979, and also for Alexandra Burke's song Start Without You, and is common in children's music, appearing in a Sunday school song called "O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E", the German group die Lollipops'
"Radio Lollipop", and is the tune of the Barney & Friends song "Alphabet Soup" (though only using the first verse's tune) as well as "If I Had One Wish" (which uses both verses).
