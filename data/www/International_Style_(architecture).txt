Cover of _The International Style_ (1932, reprinted 1996) by Henry-Russell
Hitchcock and Philip Johnson

The **International Style** is the name of a major architectural style that
developed in the 1920s and 1930s and strongly related to Modernism and Modern
architecture. It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-
Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932, based on works of architecture
from the 1920s.

It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as "the style of architecture
that emerged in Holland, France, and Germany after World War I and spread
throughout the world, becoming the dominant architectural style until the
1970s. The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass, the use
of lightweight, mass-produced, industrial materials, rejection of all ornament
and color, repetitive modular forms, and the use of flat surfaces, typically
alternating with areas of glass."[1]

## Background[edit]

Around 1900 a number of architects around the world began developing new
architectural solutions to integrate traditional precedents with new social
demands and technological possibilities. The work of Victor Horta and Henry
van de Velde in Brussels, Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona, Otto Wagner in Vienna and
Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a
common struggle between old and new. These architects were not considered part
of the International Style because they practiced in an "individualistic
manner" and seen as the last representatives of Romanticism.[2]

Prior to use of the term 'International Style', some American architects—such
as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Irving Gill—exemplified qualities
of simplification, honesty and clarity. Frank Lloyd Wright's Wasmuth Portfolio
had been exhibited in Europe and influenced the work of European modernists,
and his travels there probably influenced his own work, although he refused to
be categorized with them. His buildings of the 1920s and 1930s clearly showed
a change in the style of the architect, but in a different direction than the
International Style.

In Europe the modern movement in architecture had been called Functionalism or
Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), _L'Esprit Nouveau_ , or simply Modernism
and was very much concerned with the coming together of a new architectural
form and social reform, creating a more open and transparent society.[3]

## 1932 MoMA exhibition[edit]

The exhibition _Modern Architecture: International Exhibition_ ran from
February 9–March 23, 1932, at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), in the
Heckscher Building at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street in New York.[4] Beyond a
foyer and office, the exhibition was divided into six rooms: the "Modern
Architects" section began in the entrance room, featuring a model of William
Lescaze's Chrystie-Forsyth Street Housing Development in New York. From there
visitors moved to the centrally placed Room A, featuring a model of a mid-rise
housing development for Evanston, Illinois, by Chicago architect brothers
Monroe Bengt Bowman and Irving Bowman,[5] as well as a model and photos of
Walter Gropius's Bauhaus building in Dessau. In the largest exhibition space,
Room C, were works by Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, J.J.P. Oud and
Frank Lloyd Wright (including a project for a house on the Mesa in Denver,
1932). Room B was a section titled "Housing", presenting "the need for a new
domestic environment” as it had been identified by historian and critic Lewis
Mumford. In Room D were works by Raymond Hood (including "Apartment Tower in
the Country" and the McGraw-Hill building) and Richard Neutra. In Room E was a
section titled "The extent of modern architecture", added at the last
minute,[6] which included the works of thirty seven modern architects from
fifteen countries who were said to be influenced by the works of Europeans of
the 1920s. Among these works was shown Alvar Aalto's Turun Sanomat newspaper
offices building in Turku, Finland.

The Weissenhof Estate, Stuttgart, Germany (1927)

The "International Style", as defined by Hitchcock and Johnson, had developed
in 1920s Western Europe, shaped by the activities of the Dutch De Stijl
movement, Le Corbusier, and the Deutscher Werkbund and the Bauhaus. Le
Corbusier had embraced Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American
industrial models in order to reorganize society. He contributed to a new
journal called _L'Esprit Nouveau_ that advocated the use of modern industrial
techniques and strategies to create a higher standard of living on all socio-
economic levels. In 1927, one of the first and most defining manifestations of
the International Style was the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart, overseen by
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. It was enormously popular, with thousands of daily
visitors. [ _citation needed_ ]

After a six-week run in New York City, the exhibition then toured the USA –
the first such “traveling-exhibition” of architecture in the US – for six
years.[7] According to Terence Riley: "Ironically the (exhibition) catalogue,
and to some extent, the book _The International Style_ , published at the same
time of the exhibition, have supplanted the actual historical event."[8]

### Curators[edit]

Philip Johnson (pictured in 2002) co-defined the International Style with
Henry-Russell Hitchcock as a young college graduate, and later became one of
its practitioners.

MoMA director Alfred H. Barr hired architectural historian and critic Henry-
Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson[6] to curate the museum's first
architectural exhibition. The three of them toured Europe together in 1929.
The three of them also discussed Hitchcock's book about modern art. By
December 1930, the first written proposal for an exhibition of the "new
architecture" was set down, yet the first draft of the book was not complete
until some months later.

Previous to the 1932 exhibition and book, Hitchcock had concerned himself with
the themes of modern architecture in his 1929 book _Modern Architecture:
Romanticism and Reintegration_. Both books are seen as "operative texts" (as
defined by Italian critic Manfredo Tafuri) in that they were not merely a
history but moreover a kind of manifesto proclaiming the birth of a new
architecture.[3]

###  Definition[edit]

Hitchcock and Johnson's exhibition catalog identified three principles of the
style: volume of space (as opposed to mass and solidity), regularity, and
flexibility.[9]

Hitchcock and Johnson identified three principles: the expression of volume
rather than mass, the emphasis on balance rather than preconceived symmetry,
and the expulsion of applied ornament.

Common characteristics of the International Style include: a radical
simplification of form, a rejection of ornament, and adoption of glass, steel
and concrete as preferred materials. Further, the transparency of buildings,
construction (called the honest expression of structure), and acceptance of
industrialized mass-production techniques contributed to the international
style's design philosophy. Finally, the machine aesthetic, and logical design
decisions leading to support building function were used by the International
architect to create buildings reaching beyond historicism. The ideals of the
style are commonly summed up in three slogans: ornament is a crime, truth to
materials, form follows function; and Le Corbusier's description of houses as
"machines for living".[ _citation needed_ ]

### Notable omissions[edit]

The exhibition excluded other contemporary styles that were exploring the
boundaries of architecture at the time, including: Art Deco, German
Expressionism, for instance the works of Hermann Finsterlin, and the
Organicist movement, popularized in the work of Antoni Gaudí. As a result of
the 1932 exhibition, the principles of the International Style were endorsed,
while other styles were seen as less significant.

In 1922, the competition for the Tribune Tower and its famous second-place
entry by Eliel Saarinen gave some indication of what was to come, though these
works would not have been accepted by Hitchcock and Johnson as representing
the "International Style". Similarly, Johnson, writing about Joseph Urban's
recently completed New School for Social Research in New York, stated: "In the
New School we have an anomaly of a building supposed to be in a style of
architecture based on the development of the plan from function and facade
from plan but which is a formally and pretentiously conceived as a Renaissance
palace. Urban's admiration for the New Style is more complete than his
understanding."[6]

California architect Rudolph Schindler's work was not a part of the exhibit,
though Schindler had pleaded with Hitchcock and Johnson to be included.[10]
Then, "[f]or more than 20 years, Schindler had intermittently launched a
series of spirited, cantankerous exchanges with the museum."[11]

## 1932–1944[edit]

The Glass Palace, Heerlen, Netherlands, Frits Peutz (1935).

The gradual rise of the Nazi regime in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, and the
Nazis' rejection of modern architecture, meant that an entire generation of
avant-gardist architects, many of them Jews, were forced out of continental
Europe. Some, such as Mendelsohn, found shelter in England, while a
considerable number of the Jewish architects made their way to Palestine, and
others to the USA. However, American anti-Communist politics after the war and
Philip Johnson's influential rejection of functionalism have tended to mask
the fact that many of the important architects, including contributors to the
original Weissenhof project, fled to the Soviet Union. This group also tended
to be far more concerned with functionalism and its social agenda. Bruno Taut,
Mart Stam, the second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer, Ernst May and other
important figures of the International Style went to the Soviet Union in 1930
to undertake huge, ambitious, idealistic urban planning projects, building
entire cities from scratch. In 1936, when Stalin ordered them out of the
country, many of these architects became stateless and sought refuge
elsewhere; for example, Ernst May moved to Kenya.[12]

"White Tel Aviv", Dizengoff Circle, by Genia Averbouch, 1934

The White City of Tel Aviv refers to a collection of over 4,000 buildings
built in the International Style in the 1930s. Many Jewish architects who had
studied at the German Bauhaus school designed significant buildings here.[13]
A large proportion of the buildings built in the International Style can be
found in the area planned by Patrick Geddes, north of Tel Aviv's main
historical commercial center.[14] In 1994, UNESCO proclaimed the White City a
World Heritage Site, describing the city as "a synthesis of outstanding
significance of the various trends of the Modern Movement in architecture and
town planning in the early part of the 20th century".[15] In 1996, Tel Aviv's
White City was listed as a World Monuments Fund endangered site.[16]

Villa in Södra Ängby in western Stockholm, Sweden, Edvin Engström (1938).

The residential area of Södra Ängby in western Stockholm, Sweden, blended an
international or functionalist style with garden city ideals. Encompassing
more than 500 buildings, most of them designed by Edvin Engström, it remains
the largest coherent functionalist or "International Style" villa area in
Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century
after its construction in 1933–40 and protected as a national cultural
heritage.

With the rise of Nazism, a number of key European modern architects fled to
the USA. When Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer fled Germany they both arrived
at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, in an excellent position to extend
their influence and promote the Bauhaus as the primary source of architectural
modernism. When Mies fled in 1938, he first fled to England, but on emigrating
to the USA he went to Chicago, founded the Second School of Chicago at IIT and
solidified his reputation as a prototypical modern architect.

## 1945–[edit]

Seagram Building, New York, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1958)

After World War II, the International Style matured, Hellmuth, Obata &
Kassabaum (later renamed HOK) and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) perfected
the corporate practice, and it became the dominant approach for decades in the
US and Canada. Beginning with the initial technical and formal inventions of
860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments in Chicago its most famous examples
include the United Nations headquarters, the Lever House, the Seagram Building
in New York City, and the campus of the United States Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, as well as the Toronto-Dominion Centre in Toronto.
Further examples can be found in mid-century institutional buildings
throughout North America and the "corporate architecture" spread from there,
especially to Europe.

Tower C of Place de Ville, the tallest building in Ottawa

In Canada, this period coincided with a major building boom and few
restrictions on massive building projects. International Style skyscrapers
came to dominate many of Canada's major cities, especially Ottawa, Montreal,
Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, and Toronto. While these glass boxes
were at first unique and interesting, the idea was soon repeated to the point
of ubiquity. A typical example is the development of so-called Place de Ville,
a conglomeration of three glass skyscrapers in downtown Ottawa, where the
plans of the property developer Robert Campeau in the mid 1960s and early
1970s—in the words of historian Robert W. Collier, "forceful and abrasive, he
was not well-loved at City Hall"—had no regard for existing city plans, "built
with contempt for the existing city and for city responsibilities in the key
areas of transportation and land use".[17] Architects attempted to put new
twists into such towers, such as the Toronto City Hall by Finnish architect
Viljo Revell. By the late 1970s a backlash was under way against
modernism—prominent anti-modernists such as Jane Jacobs and George Baird were
partly based in Toronto.

The typical International Style or "corporate architecture" high-rise usually
consists of the following:

  1. Square or rectangular footprint
  2. Simple cubic "extruded rectangle" form
  3. Windows running in broken horizontal rows forming a grid
  4. All facade angles are 90 degrees.[ _citation needed_ ]

In 2000 UNESCO proclaimed Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas in Caracas,
Venezuela, as a World Heritage Site, describing it as "a masterpiece of modern
city planning, architecture and art, created by the Venezuelan architect
Carlos Raúl Villanueva and a group of distinguished avant-garde artists".[
_citation needed_ ]

In June 2007 UNESCO proclaimed Ciudad Universitaria of the Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in Mexico City, a World Heritage Site due
to its relevance and contribution in terms of international style movement (as
well as cultural – alma mater of 3 Nobel Prize winners and most Mexican
presidents).[ _citation needed_ ] It was designed in the late 1940s and built
in the mid-1950s based upon a masterplan created by architect Enrique del
Moral. His original idea was enriched by other students, teachers, and diverse
professionals of several disciplines. The university houses murals by Diego
Rivera, Juan O'Gorman and others. The university also features Olympic Stadium
(1968). In his first years of practice, Pritzker Prize winner and Mexican
architect Luis Barragán designed buildings in the International Style. But
later he evolved to a more traditional local architecture. Other notable
Mexican architects of the International Style or modern period are Carlos
Obregón Santacilia, Augusto H. Alvarez, Mario Pani, Federico Mariscal,
Vladimir Kaspé, Enrique del Moral, Juan Sordo Madaleno, Max Cetto, among many
others.

In Brazil Oscar Niemeyer proposed a more organic and sensual[18] International
Style. He designed the political landmarks (headquarters of the three state
powers) of the new, planned capital Brasilia. The masterplan for the city was
proposed by Lucio Costa.

## Criticism[edit]

In 1930, Frank Lloyd Wright wrote: "Human houses should not be like boxes,
blazing in the sun, nor should we outrage the Machine by trying to make
dwelling-places too complementary to Machinery."[19]

In Elizabeth Gordon's well-known 1953 essay, "The Threat to the Next America,"
she criticized the style and associated it with totalitarianism and
communism.[20]

In 1966, architect Robert Venturi published _Complexity and Contradiction in
Architecture_[21] , essentially a book-length critique of the International
Style. Architectural historian Vincent Scully regarded Venturi’s book as
‘probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le
Corbusier’s _Vers une Architecture_.[22] It helped to define postmodernism.

Best-selling American author Tom Wolfe wrote a book-length critique, _From
Bauhaus to Our House_ , portraying the style as elitist.

One of the strengths of the International Style has been said to be that the
design solutions were indifferent to location, site, and climate; the
solutions were supposed to be universally applicable; the style made no
reference to local history or national vernacular. This was soon identified as
one of the style's primary weaknesses.[ _citation needed_ ]

In 2006, Hugh Pearman, the British architectural critic of _The Times_ ,
observed that those using the style today are simply "another species of
revivalist", noting the irony.[23] The negative reaction to internationalist
modernism has been linked to public antipathy to overall development.[24][25]

In the preface to the 2007 fourth edition of his book _Modern Architecture: A
Critical History_ , Kenneth Frampton argued that there had been a "disturbing
Eurocentric bias" in histories of modern architecture. This "Eurocentrism"
included the USA.[26]
