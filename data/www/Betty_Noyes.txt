Elizabeth "Betty" Noyes Hand (October 11, 1912 â€“ December 24, 1987) was a singer and actress best known for dubbing two of Debbie Reynolds' numbers in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain. Today, this is a well-known example of dubbing in a movie musical; ironically, Reynolds's character in Singin' in the Rain was supposedly dubbing for another character.
She is also known for singing the song "Baby Mine" in the Disney film Dumbo (1941), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. However, she was not given screen credit for this performance. (None of the voice actors for Dumbo were credited on screen.)
