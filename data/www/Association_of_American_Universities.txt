The **Association of American Universities** ( **AAU** ) is a binational
organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong
system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in
the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.

## Organization[edit]

The AAU was founded in 1900 by a group of fourteen Ph.D.-granting universities
in the United States to strengthen and standardize American doctoral programs.
The presidents of the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Harvard
University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of California sent a
letter of invitation to nine other universities to meet at Chicago in
February, 1900 to promote and raise standards.[1][2] Today, 62 universities in
the U.S. and Canada are members and the primary purpose of the organization is
to provide a forum for the development and implementation of institutional and
national policies, in order to promote strong programs in academic research
and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.

### Benefits[edit]

The largest attraction of the AAU for many schools, especially nonmembers, is
prestige. For example, in 2010 the chancellor of nonmember North Carolina
State University described it as "the pre-eminent research-intensive
membership group. To be a part of that organization is something N.C. State
aspires to."[3] A spokesman for nonmember University of Connecticut called it
"perhaps the most elite organization in higher education. You'd probably be
hard-pressed to find a major research university that didn't want to be a
member of the AAU."[4] In 2012, the new elected chancellor of University of
Massachusetts Amherst, a nonmember of AAU, reaffirmed the framework goal of
elevating the campus to AAU standards which inspire them to become a member in
the near future, and called it a distinctive status.[5] Because of the lengthy
and difficult entrance process, boards of trustees, state legislators, and
donors often see membership as evidence of the quality of a university.[3]

The AAU acts as a lobbyist at its headquarters in the city of Washington, D.C.
for research and higher education funding and for policy and regulatory issues
affecting research universities. The association holds two meetings annually,
both in Washington. Separate meetings are held for university presidents,
provosts, and other officials. Because the meetings are private they offer the
opportunity for discussion without media coverage. Prominent government
officials, businessmen, and others often speak to the groups.[3]

### Presidents[edit]

Executive | Term  
---|---  
Thomas A. Bartlett | 1977–1982  
Robert M. Rosenzweig | 1983–1993  
Cornelius J. Pings | 1993–1998  
Nils Hasselmo | 1998–2006  
Robert M. Berdahl | 2006–2011  
Hunter R. Rawlings III | 2011–2016  
Mary Sue Coleman | 2016–present  
  
### Statistics[edit]

As of 2004, AAU members accounted for 58%[6] of U.S. universities' research
grants and contract income and 52% of all doctorates awarded in the United
States. Since 1999, 43% of all Nobel Prize winners and 74% of winners at U.S.
institutions have been affiliated with an AAU university. Approximately two
thirds of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2006 Class of Fellows are
affiliated with an AAU university. The faculties at AAU universities include
2,993 members of the United States National Academies (82% of all members):
the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the
Institute of Medicine (2004).[7]

  * Undergraduate students: 1,044,759; 7% nationally
  * Undergraduate degrees awarded: 235,328; 17% nationally
  * Graduate students: 418,066; 20% nationally
  * Master’s degrees awarded: 106,971; 19% nationally
  * Professional degrees awarded: 20,859; 25% nationally
  * Doctorates awarded: 22,747; 52% nationally
  * Postdoctoral fellows: 30,430; 67% nationally
  * Students studying abroad: 57,205
  * National Merit/Achievement Scholars (2004): 5,434; 63% nationally
  * Faculty: approximately 72,000

## Membership[edit]

AAU membership is by invitation only, which requires an affirmative vote of
three fourths of current members. Invitations are considered periodically,
based in part on an assessment of the breadth and quality of university
programs of research and graduate education, as well as undergraduate
education. The association ranks its members using four criteria: research
spending, the percentage of faculty who are members of the National Academies,
faculty awards, and citations. Two thirds of members can vote to revoke
membership for poor rankings.[8][9] As of 2010[update] annual dues are
$80,500.[3] All 60 US members of the AAU are also classified as Highest
Research Activity (R1) Universities by the Carnegie Classification of
Institutions of Higher Education.

**Notes:**

###  Former members[edit]

  * Catholic University of America (1900–2002)

    Departed as a result of "institutional emphases and energies" that differed from the other AAU members.[11]

  * Clark University (1900–1999)

    Departed because of a shift in the AAU's emphasis to large research universities.[12]

  * University of Nebraska–Lincoln (1909–2011)

    Removed from the AAU.[9] Chancellor Harvey Perlman claimed that the lack of an on-campus medical school (the Medical Center is a separate campus of the University of Nebraska system) and the AAU's disregarding of USDA-funded agricultural research in its metrics hurt the university's performance in the association's internal ranking system.[8]

  * Syracuse University (1966–2011)

    Because of a dispute over how to count non-federal grants, Syracuse voluntarily withdrew from the AAU in 2011. The _Chronicle of Higher Education_ reported that after "it became clear that Syracuse wouldn't meet the association's revised membership criteria, university officials decided that they would leave the organization voluntarily, rather than face a vote like Nebraska's, and notified the leadership of their intentions."[13]

## Advocacy[edit]

The AAU supported the Research and Development Efficiency Act (H.R. 5056;
113th Congress) arguing that the legislation "can lead to a long-needed
reduction in the regulatory burden currently imposed on universities and their
faculty members who conduct research on behalf of the federal government."[14]
According to the AAU, "too often federal requirements" for accounting for
federal grant money "are ill-conceived, ineffective, and/or duplicative."[14]
This wastes the researchers' times and "reduces the time they can devote to
discovery and innovation and increases institutional compliance costs."[14]
AAU institutions are frequently involved in U.S. science policy debates. In
2008, AAU Vice President for Policy, Tobin Smith, co-authored a textbook on
U.S. science policy.
