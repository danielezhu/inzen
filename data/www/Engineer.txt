Engineers are people who design, construct, and maintain structures, materials and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). The foundation education of an engineer is typically a 4-year bachelor's degree or in some countries, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus 4â€“6 years peer-reviewed professional practice culminating in a project report or thesis.
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.
