The American Composers Alliance (ACA) is an American membership organization dedicated to the publishing and promoting of American contemporary classical music. Founded in 1937 by Aaron Copland, Milton Adolphus and others, it is the oldest national organization of its kind, and represents over 200 member composers.
The organization is based in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Each year since 1951 it has presented the Laurel Leaf Award individuals and organizations in recognition of "distinguished achievement in fostering and encouraging American music."
The American Composers Alliance publishes musical scores under the imprint American Composers Edition (ACE). Since 2001, it has held an annual festival of American music each June, presenting 6-8 concerts with more than 30 composers from across the country. Past festivals received favorable reviews from The New York Times and New Music Connoisseur. In 2007, ACA celebrated its 70th anniversary.
