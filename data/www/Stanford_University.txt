Stanford

Location in California

**Stanford University** (officially **Leland Stanford Junior University**
,[11] colloquially _the Farm_ ) is a private research university in Stanford,
California, in Silicon Valley, 20 miles (30 km) outside of San Jose. Due to
its academic strength, wealth, and proximity to Silicon Valley it is often
cited as one of the world's most prestigious
universities.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of
their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15
the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S.
Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its
first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-
denominational institution.

Stanford University struggled financially after Leland Stanford's death in
1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake.[20] Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported
faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local
industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley.[21] The university is
also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the
first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[22]

There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate
students and another four professional schools. Stanford's undergraduate
program is the most selective in the United States.[23][24][25][26][27]
Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two
private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. It has gained
115 NCAA team championships,[28] the most for a university (one more than
UCLA), 483 individual championships, the most in Division I,[29] and has won
the NACDA Directors' Cup, recognizing the university with the best overall
athletic team achievement, for 22 consecutive years, beginning in
1994–1995.[30] In addition, Stanford students and alumni have won 270 Olympic
medals including 139 gold medals.[31]

Stanford faculty and alumni have founded a large number of companies that
produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-
largest economy in the world.[32] It is the alma mater of 30 living
billionaires, 17 astronauts, and 20 Turing Award laureates.[note 1] It is also
one of the leading producers of members of the United States Congress.[53][54]
67 Nobel laureates and 7 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford
as students, alumni, faculty or staff.[55]

## History[edit]

Center of the campus in 1891.[56]

Main article: History of Stanford University

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated
to Leland Stanford Jr, their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on
Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in
both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to
preserve artifacts related to World War I. The Stanford Medical Center,
completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory (originally named the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center), which was established in 1962, performs research in
particle physics.[57]

Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern
universities and most specifically Cornell University and Harvard University.
Stanford opened being called the "Cornell of the West" in 1891 due to faculty
being former Cornell professors and alumni including its first president,
David Starr Jordan. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have
higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to
men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt
this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an
early adopter as well.[58]

## Land[edit]

An aerial photograph of the center of the Stanford University campus in 2008.

Most of Stanford University is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[7]
campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is located on the
San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley
(Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and
approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. In 2008, 60% of this
land remained undeveloped.[61]

Stanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within
unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (such
as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the
city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated
San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park
(Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[62]

### Central campus[edit]

The academic central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino
Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard, and Sand Hill Road. The
United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP codes: 94305 for campus
mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.

center background from across the grass covered Oval.

### Non-central campus[edit]

Stanford currently operates or intends to operate in various locations outside
of its central campus.

On the founding grant:

  * Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research.
  * SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[63]
  * Golf course and a seasonal lake: The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012 Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[64]

Off the founding grant:

  * Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892.
  * Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a "mini-Stanford."[65]
  * China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[66][67]

Locations in development:

  * Redwood City: in 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[68][69] In 2015 the university announced a development plan.[70]

Lake Lagunita in early spring; the Dish, a large radio telescope and local
landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is
the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.

### Faculty residences[edit]

Many Stanford faculty members live in the "Faculty Ghetto", within walking or
biking distance of campus.[71] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned
entirely by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and
sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the
"Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon
Valley values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property,
and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than
in Palo Alto.[ _citation needed_ ]

### Other uses[edit]

Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the
Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also
leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several
schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[72] El Camino
Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford
land.[73]

### Landmarks[edit]

Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the
Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford
Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin sculpture
garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the
Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd
Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are
both listed on the National Historic Register. The Claw (officially White
Memorial Fountain) between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a
popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of “fountain
hopping”; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a
national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949,
William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and
one shortly after in 1952.[74][75][76][77]

## Administration and organization[edit]

Stanford University is a tax-exempt corporate trust governed by a privately
appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[6][note 3]
Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet
five times annually.[79] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by
ballot.[78] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the
Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford
University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[80]

The Board appoints a President to serve as the chief executive officer of the
university and prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, manage
financial and business affairs, and appoint nine vice presidents.[81] The
Provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of
the seven schools report.[82][83] Persis Drell became the 13th Provost in
February 2017.

As of 2013 the university was organized into seven academic schools.[84] The
schools of Humanities and Sciences (27 departments), Engineering (9
departments), and Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (4 departments) have
both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine,
Education and Business have graduate programs only. The powers and authority
of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure
and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy
centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other
academic administrators, but most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate,
made up of 55 elected representatives of the faculty.[85]

The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student
government for Stanford University and all registered students are members.
Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the
undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate
students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the
entire student body.[86]

Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California
Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long
as the property is used for educational purposes.[87]

### Endowment and fundraising[edit]

The university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was
valued at $22.2 billion in August 2015, 3.6% over the previous year.[88][89]
The endowment fell 25% in 2009 as a result of the late-2000s recession, but
posted gains of 14.4% in 2010 and 22.4% in 2011, when it was valued at $16.5
billion.[90]

Stanford has been the top fundraising university in the United States for
several years. It raised $911 million in 2006,[91] $832 million in 2007,[92]
$785 million in 2008,[93] $640 million in 2009,[94] $599 million in 2010,[95]
$709 million in 2011,[96] and $1.035 billion in 2012, becoming the first
school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[22] In 2013 and 2014 it
raised $932 million and $928 million.[96] Payouts from the Stanford endowment
covered approximately 23% of University expenses in the 2014 fiscal year,
compared to Princeton at 55% and Harvard at 35%.[97]

In 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the
Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009,
two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the
campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised a total of $6.23
billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion
held by Yale.[98][99] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for
undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in
"Seeking Solutions" to global problems, $1.61 billion for "Educating Leaders"
by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for "Foundation of Excellence"
aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds
supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs
for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled
the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the
business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new
art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; a new art museum; and
a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[100][101]

## Academics[edit]

### Teaching and learning[edit]

Walkway in the Main Quad

Stanford follows a quarter system with Autumn quarter usually starting in late
September and Spring Quarter ending in early June.[102] The full-time, four-
year undergraduate program has an arts and sciences focus with high graduate
student coexistence.[102] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of
Schools and Colleges.[103]

Full-time undergraduate tuition was $42,690 for 2013–2014.[104] Stanford's
admission process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents; while
it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid,
with an average aid package of $31,411.[104] In 2012–13, the university
awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an
average aid package of $40,460.[104] Eighty percent of students receive some
form of financial aid.[104] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[104] For
undergraduates admitted in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for
most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below
$125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000
may have tuition significantly reduced.[105] 17% of students receive Pell
Grants,[104] a common measure of low-income students at a college.

### Research centers and institutes[edit]

From the Hoover Tower one can see all of the Stanford campus. Pictured is the
Main Quad and Serra Mall.

As of 2016 the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw
eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.[106]

Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford
Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the
university), the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace (a major
public policy think tank that attracts visiting scholars from around the
world) and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design
school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of
Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management
education).[ _citation needed_ ]

Stanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education
Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King
papers held by the King Center.[107] It also runs the John S. Knight
Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions,
which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing
the ocean.[108]

Together with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the
BioHub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600
million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and
pediatrician Priscilla Chan.

### Libraries and digital resources[edit]

Green Library

Main article: Stanford University Libraries

As of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than
9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million
e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million
microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources.[109]

The main library in the SU library system is Green Library, which also
contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading
rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds
various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East
Asia collections with 540,000 volumes.

### Arts[edit]

Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including
these _Burghers of Calais_.

Stanford University is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts museum with
24 galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established
in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The
Center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world[110]
The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, built in 1917, serves as a teaching
resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition
venue. There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily
sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden
near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and "totem poles."

The Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs,
the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind
Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head
Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[111] the Stanford Shakespeare
Society, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works
of Gilbert and Sullivan. There are award-winning a cappella music groups
including the Mendicants,[112] Counterpoint,[113] the Stanford Fleet Street
Singers,[114] Harmonics, Mixed Company,[115] Testimony, Talisman, Everyday
People, and Raagapella.[116]

Notably, Stanford ranks high and often first in many domestic college ranking
measures, leading _Slate_ to dub Stanford in 2014 as "the Harvard of the 21st
century,"[127] and _The New York Times_ in the same year to conclude that
"Stanford University has become America’s 'it' school, by measures that
Harvard once dominated."[128] From polls done by _The Princeton Review_ in
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the most commonly named "dream college" for
students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named
Stanford as their "dream college."[129] The inaugural 2017 Wall Street
Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings picked Stanford as the No. 1
school in the United States.[130]

Gate to the Main Quad

Globally, the _Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)_ ranked Stanford
second in the world most years from 2003 to 2016.[131] Additionally, _Times
Higher Education_ recognized Stanford as one of the world's "six super brands"
on its _World Reputation Rankings_ , along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard,
MIT, and Oxford.[132]

## Discoveries and innovation[edit]

See also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and
innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and
innovation

### Natural sciences[edit]

  * Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg synthesized DNA material and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1959 for his work at Stanford.
  * First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[133][134] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.
  * Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[135][136]
  * Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new ways and methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[137][138]

### Computer and applied sciences[edit]

  * ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[139][140]
  * Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.
  * Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[141] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP). The SDLP's goal was “to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library" and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[142]
  * Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[143] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.
  * RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the Power Architecture. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[144]
  * SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[145] which led to Sun Microsystems.

### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]

Main article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni

Stanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and
licensing its inventions to existing companies; it is often held up as a model
for technology transfer.[146][147] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing
is responsible for commercializing developments. The university is described
as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often
funded, to launch their own companies.[148] Some companies closely associated
with Stanford include:

  * Cisco, 1984, founders Leonard Bosack (M.S) and Sandy Lerner (M.S) who were in charge of Stanford Computer Science and Graduate School of Business computer operations groups respectively when the hardware was developed.[149]
  * Coursera, 2012, founders Andrew Ng (Associate Professor) and Daphne Koller (Professor, PhD).
  * Google, 1998, founders Larry Page (M.S) and Sergey Brin (M.S).
  * Hewlett-Packard, 1939, founders William R. Hewlett (B.S, PhD) and David Packard (M.S).
  * Silicon Graphics, 1981, co-founders James H. Clark (Associate Professor) and several of his grad students.
  * Sun Microsystems, 1982, co-founders Vinod Khosla (M.B.A), Andy Bechtolsheim (PhD) and Scott McNealy (M.B.A).
  * Yahoo!, 1994, founders Jerry Yang (B.S, M.S) and David Filo (M.S).

Companies founded by Stanford alumni though not necessarily while at Stanford
generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-
largest economy in the world.[32]

Stanford enrolled 7,061 undergraduate[104] and 11,075 graduate students[104]
as of October 2013, and women comprised 47% of undergraduates and 41% of
professional and graduate students.[104] In the same academic year, the
freshman retention rate was 99%.

Stanford awarded 1,715 undergraduate degrees, 2,278 Master's degrees, 764
doctoral degrees, and 366 professional degrees in the 2011–2012 school
year.[104] The four-year graduation rate in the class of 2011 was 76%, and the
six-year rate was 96%.[104] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a
function of the university's coterminal degree (or "coterm") program, which
allows students to earn a master's degree as an extension of their
undergraduate program.[152]

As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation
students.[153]

### Dormitories and student housing[edit]

Main article: Stanford University student housing

As of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university
housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all
undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate
years.[104][154] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including
dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[155] At
Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as "temporary" housing from
1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball,
Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[156][157] Most student
residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or
bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshman,
sophomores, or upperclass students and some are open to all four classes. Most
residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female
sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House.
In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are
configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender
floors).[158]

Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.

Several residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language and
Culture Houses include EAST (Education And Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld
(International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed
House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française
(French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European
Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language
and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino
Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur
Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court).
Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall
(Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global
Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[155] Theme houses predating the
current "theme" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through
Nonviolence, since 1970),[159] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since
1972).[160]

Co-ops or "Self-Ops" are another housing option. These houses feature
cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work
to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces.
These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many
co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576
Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest
(EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[161] and
Synergy.[162] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa
fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[163]

As of 2015 around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on
campus.[164] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing.
Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus
housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[165]

### Athletics[edit]

Main article: Stanford Cardinal

The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with
arrangements of "All Right Now" and other contemporary music.

As of 2016 Stanford had 16 male varsity sports and 20 female varsity
sports,[166] 19 club sports[167] and about 27 intramural sports[168] In 1930,
following a unanimous vote by the Executive Committee for the Associated
Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot "Indian." The Indian
symbol and name were later dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after
objections from Native American students and a vote by the student
senate.[169] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the "Stanford
Cardinal", referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is
a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field
hockey[170] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I
FBS.

Its traditional sports rival is Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the
East Bay. The winner of the annual "Big Game" between the Cal and Cardinal
football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[171]

Stanford has had at least one NCAA team champion every year since the 1976–77
school year[172] and has earned 115 NCAA national team titles since its
establishment, the most among universities (one more than the four times
larger enrollment UCLA Bruins), and Stanford has won 483 individual national
championships, the most by any university.[28] Stanford has won the award for
the top-ranked Division 1 athletic program — the NACDA Directors' Cup,
formerly known as the Sears Cup – annually for the past twenty-three straight
years.[173][174][175][176] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Olympic
Games since 1912, winning 270 Olympic medals total, 139 of them gold.[177] In
the 2008 Summer Olympics, and 2016 Summer Olympics, Stanford won more Olympic
medals than any other university in the United States.[178][179] Stanford
athletes won 16 medals at the 2012 Summer Games (12 gold, 2 silver and 2
bronze), and 27 medals at the 2016 Summer Games.[180]

### Traditions[edit]

Vintage Stanford University postcard

  * The unofficial motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is " _Die Luft der Freiheit weht._ "[181] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, "The wind of freedom blows." The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1]
  * "Hail, Stanford, Hail" is the Stanford Hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various University singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in Economics and later became associate professor of Sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[182][183]
  * Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[184][185] but in 1953 the degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman was created to recognize individuals who give rare and extraordinary service to the University. Technically, this degree is awarded by the Stanford Associates, a voluntary group that is part of the university's alumni association. As Stanford's highest honor, it is not conferred at prescribed intervals, but only when appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[186]
  * Big Game events: The events in the week leading up to the Big Game vs. UC Berkeley, including Gaieties (a musical written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society),[187]
  * Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[188] It is now open to all students.
  * Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween Party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[189] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[190] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[191]
  * Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[192]

### Religious life[edit]

Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford
Office for Religious Life's mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance
spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University
community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring
friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean
with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean. Stanford
Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public
Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian"
tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached
usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has
multifaith services.[193] In addition the church is used by the Catholic
community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford.
Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over 20 years
allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.

In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for
Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third
floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a
seminar room, a student lounge area and a reading room, as well as offices
housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the
Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not
all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes
organizations that serve atheist, Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam,
Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[194]

The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was
intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of
their course and work schedules; the center displays the "Windhover" paintings
by Nathan Olivera, the late Stanford professor and artist.[195]

Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to
the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[196] and
Hillel at Stanford.[197]

### Greek life[edit]

Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since
1891, when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald
Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[198]
However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on
sororities in 1977.[199] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or
sorority until Spring quarter of their freshman year.[200]

As of 2016 Stanford had 31 Greek organizations, including 14 sororities and 16
fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations are housed (eight in University-
owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house [though the land is the
University][201]). Six chapters were members of the African American Fraternal
and Sororal Association, 11 chapters were members of the Interfraternity
Council, 7 chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters
belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[202]

  * Stanford is home to three unhoused historically NPHC (National Pan-Hellenic Council or "Divine Nine") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Sigma Gamma Rho) and three unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Phi Beta Sigma). These fraternities and sororities operate under the AAFSA (African American Fraternal Sororal Association) at Stanford.[203][ _citation needed_ ]
  * Seven historically NPC (National Panhellenic Conference) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[203][ _citation needed_ ]
  * Eleven historically NIC (National Interfraternity Conference) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Phi Epsilon), and six housed fraternities (Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, and Theta Delta Chi). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[203][ _citation needed_ ]
  * There are also four unhoused MGC (Multicultural Greek Council) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[204]

### Student groups[edit]

As of 2014 Stanford had 650 student organizations.[205] Groups are often,
though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed
by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include "special
fees", which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups
span from Athletic/Recreational (see section on Athletics), Careers/Pre-
professional, Community Service, Ethnic/Cultural, Fraternities/Sororities,
Health/Counseling, Media/Publications, Music/Dance/Creative Arts (see section
on Arts), Political/Social Awareness to Religious/Philosophical.

The _Stanford Daily_ is the daily newspaper and has been published since the
University was founded in 1892.[206] The Stanford Review is a conservative
student newspaper founded in 1987.[207] The student-run radio station, KZSU
Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and
news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[208]

Students run _SUpost.com_ , an online marketplace for Stanford students and
alumni, in partnership with Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) and the
Stanford Pre-Business Association.[209] The latter is intended to build
connections among industry, alumni, and student communities. Stanford
Marketing is a student group that provides students hands on training through
research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as
workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.[210][211] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and
internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. The Business
Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), is one of the
largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.
Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs. Stanford Women In
Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization consisting of over a
board of 40 and 100 active members. Each year, SWIB organizes over 25 events
and workshops, hosts a winter and spring conference, and provides mentorship
and spring quarter internships. StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for
student and faculty-led startups[212] that over 12% of the study body has
applied to. It is staffed primarily by students.

Other groups include:

  * The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[213]
  * The Stanford solar car project, in which students build a solar-powered car every 2 years and race it in either the North American Solar Challenge or the World Solar Challenge.
  * The Pilipino American Student Union (PASU),[214] a culture-oriented community service and social activism group. Also integral to PASU is a traditional performing arts arm called Kayumanggi.
  * The Stanford Improvisors (SIMPS for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[215] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[216] and they've since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[217]
  * Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India the university campus.[218][219][220]

### Safety[edit]

Stanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and
safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by
arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[221] The department
is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the
previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[222] Fire protection has
been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[223]

Murder is rare on the campus though a few of the cases have been notorious
including Theodore Streleski's murder of his professor in 1978 and the
unsolved 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church.[224]

In 2014, Stanford University was the tenth highest in the nation in "total of
reports of rape" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[225]

In Stanford University's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female
undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the
university and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[226]
According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford
students and 80% were men.[226] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were
frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: "Nearly three-
fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault
indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or person taking advantage
of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70
percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving
nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same."[226] Associated
Students of Stanford University and student and alumni activists with the
anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for
downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate
boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually
assaulted.[226] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from _The
Washington Post_ analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the
U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten
universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when
analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[227]

Main article: People v. Turner

Early in the morning of January 18, 2015, a woman visiting campus to attend a
party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a
freshman who had a swimming scholarship. The assault was interrupted by two
Swedish graduate students.[228] Stanford immediately referred the case to
prosecutors and offered the woman counseling, and within two weeks had barred
Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[229] Turner was
convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a
jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to
register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year
prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[230] The case
and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[231] The judge
in the case, a Stanford graduate, faced a recall effort in the aftermath.[228]

See also: Joe Lonsdale § Personal

In February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment
lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[232][233] Lonsdale and
Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a
junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[233] By
the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed
charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against
consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually
assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from
Stanford for 10 years.[233] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had
had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding
and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[234] Clougherty withdrew her suit that
fall as well.[235]

included) of the Turing Award, the so-called "Nobel Prize in computer
science", comprising one third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The
university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with 4 Gödel Prize
winners, 4 Knuth Prize recipients, 10 IJCAI Computers and Thought Award
winners, and about 15 Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the
foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies
and, according to _Forbes_ , has produced the second highest number of
billionaires of all universities.[240][241][242]

13 Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[243][244][245][246][247] As of
2016, 116 Stanford students or alumni have been named Rhodes Scholars.[248]
Four more were named in 2017.[249]

  2. **^** It is often stated that Stanford has the largest contiguous campus in the world (or the United States)[59][60] but that depends on definitions. Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).
  3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be just trustees and that the university president would be a trustee ex officio.[78] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant appointed in 1891 died in 1942.
