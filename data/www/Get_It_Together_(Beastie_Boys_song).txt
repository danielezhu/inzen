"Get It Together" is a song by American hip-hop group the Beastie Boys, released as the second single from their fourth studio album Ill Communication. The album version of the song features rapper Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest, but not the single version.
The song contains vocal samples from the song "Headless Heroes" by Eugene McDaniels, and heavily samples a loop from "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" by the Moog Machine, from the album Switched-On Rock.
The song also appears on the group's compilation The Sounds of Science.
