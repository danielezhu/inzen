Animated family films have performed consistently well at the box office, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story films, the Finding Nemo films, and Inside Out have been the best performers; beyond Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age, Madagascar and Despicable Me series have met with the most success. The Peter Pan, Jungle Book, Mickey Mouse, and Bambi series saw successful returns after lying dormant for decades.
DreamWorks Animation films have grossed the most, with over $13.8 billion across 33 films, while Illumination Entertainment films have the best average with $741.4 million per film across six films. John Lasseter's films have grossed the most of any animated director, with a total of $18 billion, while Chris Meledandri has the best average $605.6 million per film across 10 films as of February 2017.
