# Forbes Magazine's List of America's Best Colleges

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

In 2008, Forbes.com began publishing an annual list, prepared by the _Center
for College Affordability and Productivity_[1] of "America's Best
Colleges".[2] **Student satisfaction** (evaluations from RateMyProfessors.com,
retention rates and targeted student satisfaction surveys on Facebook)
constitutes 75% of the score. **Post-graduate success** (self-reported
salaries of alumni from PayScale, alumni appearing on the CCAP's _America's
Leaders List_ ) constitutes 32.5% of the score. **Student debt loads**
constitute 25% of the score. The **graduation rate** (the proportion of
students who complete four-year degrees in four years) constitutes 7.5% of the
score. **Academic success** (the proportion of students receiving nationally
competitive awards) constitutes 10% of the score. Public reputation is not
considered, which causes some colleges to score lower than in other lists. A
three-year moving average is used to smooth out the scoring.

Starting in 2013, four schools that had admitted to misreporting admissions
data were removed from the list for two years. The four removed colleges were
Bucknell University, Claremont McKenna College, Emory University, and Iona
College.[3]
