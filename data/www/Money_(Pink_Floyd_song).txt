"Money" is a song by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd from their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Written by Roger Waters, it opened side two of the LP.
Released as a single, it became the band's first hit in the United States, reaching No. 10 in Cash Box magazine and No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. "Money" is noted for its unusual 7/4â€“4/4 time signature, and the tape loop of money-related sound effects (such as a ringing cash register and a jingle of coins) that is heard periodically throughout the song, including on its own at the beginning.
