Yeshiva University is a private university in New York City, with four campuses in New York City. Founded in 1886, it is a research university.
The university's undergraduate schools—Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, and Syms School of Business—offer a dual curriculum inspired by Modern-Centrist-Orthodox Judaism's hashkafa (philosophy) of Torah Umadda ("Torah and secular knowledge") combining academic education with the study of the Torah.
While the majority of students at the University are of the Jewish faith, many students, especially at School of Law and the School of Business, are not Jewish. Yeshiva University is an independent institution chartered by New York State. It is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and by several professional agencies.
