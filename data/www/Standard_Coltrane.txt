Standard Coltrane is an album credited to jazz musician John Coltrane, released in 1962 on Prestige Records, catalogue 7243. It is assembled from unissued results of a single recording session at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1958. As Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s long after he had stopped recording for the label, Prestige used unissued recordings to create new marketable albums without Coltrane's input or approval.
