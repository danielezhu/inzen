The Kent Music Report was a weekly record chart of Australian music singles and albums which was compiled by music enthusiast David Kent from May 1974 through to 1988. After 1988, the Australian Recording Industry Association, who had been using the report under licence for a number of years, chose to produce their own charts as the 'ARIA Charts'.
Prior to the Kent Report, Go-Set magazine published weekly Top-40 Singles from 1966 and Album charts from 1970 until the magazine's demise in August 1974.
David Kent later publicised the Australian charts from 1940â€“1973 in a retrospective fashion using state by state chart data obtained from various Australian radio stations.
