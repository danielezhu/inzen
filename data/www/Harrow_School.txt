Harrow School /ˈhæroʊ/ is an independent boarding school for boys in Harrow, London, England. There is some evidence that there has been a school on the site since 1243, but the Harrow School of today was founded in 1572 by John Lyon under a Royal Charter of Elizabeth I. Harrow is one of the original nine public schools that were regulated by the Public Schools Act 1868. For the academic year 2015/16, Harrow charges boarders up to £12,050 per term, being the fifth most expensive boarding school in the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.
The school has an enrolment of 805 boys spread across twelve boarding houses, all of whom board full-time. It remains one of four all-boys, full-boarding schools in Britain, the others being Eton College, Radley College and Winchester College. Harrow's uniform includes straw hats, morning suits, top hats and canes. Its alumni include eight former British or Indian Prime Ministers (including Peel, Palmerston, Baldwin, Churchill and Nehru), foreign statesmen, former and current members of both houses of the U.K. Parliament, three
kings and several other members of various royal families, three Nobel Prize winners, twenty Victoria Cross and one George Cross holders, and many figures in the arts and sciences.
