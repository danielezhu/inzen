Music has always been a part of Afghans' lives but since the late 1970s the country has been involved in constant wars and people were less concerned about music. As such, music in Afghanistan has been suppressed and recording for outsiders is minimal, despite a rich musical heritage.
Located on the crossroads between many trade routes, Afghanistan's music tradition was influenced by Arabs, Persians, Indians, Mongolians, Chinese and many others passing through. Thus Afghan music features a mix of Persian melodies, Arab scales, Indian compositional principles as well as sounds from ethnic groups such as the Pashtuns or Tajiks and the instruments used range from Indian tablas to long-necked lutes. It is worth noting that the most influential musical tradition in the subcontinent--the Indian musical tradition--owes a significant debt to Afghanistan. Although Afghan musical traditions did not influence the Indian musical traditions, the development and evolution of Indian musical tradition was primarily facilitated by the invading and conquering Afghan royalty (the Moguls) and nobility who invested a great deal of enthusiasm and wealth in bringing the great Indian musical tradition out of the temples (where music was mainly a part of the worship services) and transforming it into an indispensable part of daily life.
During the 1990s, the Taliban governments banned instrumental music and much public music-making. In spite of arrests and destruction of musical instruments, musicians have continued to play their trade into the present. The multi-ethnic city of Kabul has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the city of Herat, which is home to traditions more closely related to Iranian music than in the rest of the country. Lyrics throughout most of Afghanistan are typically in Dari (Persian) and Pashto.
