Zoo was a British (and formerly an Australian and South African) lads' magazine published weekly by Bauer Media Group in the United Kingdom. It was launched on 29 January 2004, and for a time was the UK's only men's weekly after the similar and rival magazine Nuts closed in April 2014.
On 17 November 2015, Zoo announced on its website that it would be suspending publication.
Zoo consisted of a mix of comedy news, sports commentary, photos of glamour models, jokes (of the pub joke style), an entertainments guide (covering TV, cinema, video/computer games and music), fashion/grooming and comical/rude pictures sent in by readers.
