The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and now a division of Harvard University, carries on many of the research and professional development programs that Radcliffe College pioneered and has introduced other programs to the worldwide community of scholars. It is one of the nine member institutions of the Some Institutes for Advanced Study consortium.
The Institute studies the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences, comprising three programs:
The Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program annually supports the work of 50 artists and scholars, with an acceptance rate of only 5 percent each year.
The Academic Ventures program fosters collaborative research projects and sponsors lectures and conferences that engage scholars with the public.
The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America documents the lives of American women of the past and present for the future.
The Radcliffe Institute offers a calendar of events to share emerging and engaging ideas in all disciplines with the public - for attendees in Cambridge and thousands who watch the video coverage of the lectures, conferences, and performances.
Lizabeth Cohen, the Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
