A publicist is a person whose job it is to generate and manage publicity for a public figure, especially a celebrity or for a work such as a book, film or album. Most top-level publicists work in private practice, handling multiple clients. The term "publicist" was coined by Columbia law professor Francis Lieber (1800â€“1872) to describe the public-like role of internationalists during the late nineteenth century. (While the term "publicist" is used with regard to those handling publicity within the entertainment realm, the term "public relations practitioner" is generally assigned to those publicizing businesses or non-profit organizations.)
