A keyboardist is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists.

Hammond and other electric organs such as the Farfisa and Vox Continental
analog synthesizers such as Moog, ARP, and units produced by a variety of other manufacturers such as Alesis.
