Troy Collins of All About Jazz calls Halvorson "[a] singular talent...Brooklyn-based guitarist Mary Halvorson has come into her own as a composer and improviser...light years ahead of her peers, she is the most impressive guitarist of her generation. The future of jazz guitar starts here." Jon Garelick of The Phoenix writes, "It's that search for her own thing that's made Halvorson...one of the most celebrated young guitarists in jazz, someone who has a unique sound both as a player and a composer."
