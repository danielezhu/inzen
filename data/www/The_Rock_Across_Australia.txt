The Rock Across Australia, or "TRAA", is a compilation of weekly Christian charts according to the number of radio plays in Australia. It published its first report on 15 February 1999 and has been serving the Christian music community and Christian radio sector ever since. The chart listed the top 30 most played songs. It named Michael W Smith as Artist of the Year for 2002 and his track, "Purified", as Song of the Year. In March 2009 TRAA's researcher was Wes Jay.
