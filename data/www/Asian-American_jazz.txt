Asian-American jazz is a musical movement in the United States begun in the 20th century mainly, though not exclusively, by Asian-American jazz musicians.
Although Asian Americans had been performing jazz music almost since that music's inception in the early 1900s, it was not until the late 20th century when a distinctly Asian-American brand of jazz began to develop, sometimes drawing on traditional Asian music and/or using Asian instruments.
