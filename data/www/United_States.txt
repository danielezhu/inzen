The **United States of America** ( **USA** ), commonly known as the **United
States** ( **U.S.** ) or **America** , is a federal republic[15][16] composed
of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and
various possessions.[fn 6] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)[18]
and with over 325 million people, the United States is the world's third- or
fourth-largest country by total area[fn 7] and the third-most populous. The
capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York
City. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous and
located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in
the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and
across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The state of Hawaii is an
archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about
the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time
zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United
States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.[23]

Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least
15,000 years ago.[24] European colonization began in the 16th century. The
United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the
East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following
the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775,
and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783
with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a
European power.[25] The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the
first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in
1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked
on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century,
acquiring new territories,[26] displacing Native American tribes, and
gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[26]
During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the outlawing
of slavery.[27][28] By the end of the century, the United States had extended
into the Pacific Ocean,[29] and its economy, driven in large part by the
Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[30] The Spanish–American War and World
War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United
States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to
develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War,
the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating
with the 1969 moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole
superpower.[31]

The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank,
International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other
international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country,
with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by
PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[32] The U.S.
economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas[33][34] and is largely post-
industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based
activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in
the world.[35] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[9]
Americans hold 33.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of
global wealth concentrated in a single country.[36] The United States ranks
among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance,
including average wage,[37] human development, per capita GDP, and
productivity per person.[38] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the
world, making up a third of global military spending,[39] and is a leading
political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[40]

## Etymology

See also: Naming of America, Names for United States citizens, and American
(word)

The _Americas_ are named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[41]

In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on
which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere _America_ in honor of the
Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin:  Americus
Vespucius).[42] The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of
America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan,
Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the
Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish
to carry the "full and ample powers of the United States of America" to Spain
to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[43][44][45] The first known
publication of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay
in _The Virginia Gazette_ newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6,
1776.[46]

The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson
and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared "The name of this
Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'".[47] The final version
of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the
sentence "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of
America'".[48] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough
draught" of the Declaration of Independence.[47] This draft of the document
did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written
before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles
of Confederation.[47]

The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the
"U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and,
internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs
of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it
appears in the name "District of Columbia".[49]

The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a
collection of independent states—e.g., "the United States are"—including in
the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in
1865.[50] The singular form—e.g., "the United States is"—became popular after
the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the
plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States". The difference is
more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states
and a unit.[51]

A citizen of the United States is an "American". "United States", "American"
and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S.
forces"). In English, the word "American" rarely refers to topics or subjects
not connected with the United States.[52]

### Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history

Further information: History of Native Americans in the United States

Monks Mound in Cahokia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest and most
influential settlement in Mississippian culture. The concrete staircase
follows the approximate course of ancient wooden stairs.

The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the
Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing
evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[53] After crossing the land bridge,
the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast[54][55] or
through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide
ice sheets.[56] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is
considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the
Americas.[57] While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th
century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas,[58] in
recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.[59]

Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and
some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast,
developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level
societies.[60] From approximately 800 to 1600 AD[61] the Mississippian culture
flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most
complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[62]
While in the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture developed.[63]
Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in the United States are credited to
the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park
and Taos Pueblo. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy
(Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth[64] and
fifteenth centuries,[65] lasting until the end of the Revolutionary War.[66]

The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of
continuing debate.[67] Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement
as early as 124 AD.[68] During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook
became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[69] After his
initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbour, Kauai, Cook named the
archipelago the "Sandwich Islands" after the fourth Earl of Sandwich—the
acting First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Royal Navy.[70]

### European settlements

colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies

Saint Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-
established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[71]

_TheMayflower Compact, 1620_ by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris

After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, other
explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in territory of the modern
United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made
his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are
accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in
Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set up the first settlements in
Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[71] and Santa Fe. The French
established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English
settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia
Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many
settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom.
The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of
Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims
before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established
precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and
constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[72][73]

Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries
developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops
included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs,
fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late
colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron
supply.[74] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and
serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-
Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured
servants pushed further west.[75]

A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[76] The life
expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south,
because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid
increase in the numbers of slaves.[77][78] Colonial society was largely
divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies
passed acts for and against the practice.[79][80] But by the turn of the 18th
century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop
labor, especially in southern regions.[81]

With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would
become the United States of America were established.[82] All had local
governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to
the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating
support for republicanism.[83] With extremely high birth rates, low death
rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively
small Native American populations were eclipsed.[84] The Christian revivalist
movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest
in both religion and religious liberty.[85]

During the Seven Years' War (in the United States, known as the French and
Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone
population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding
the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British
colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of
Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was
such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born
overseas.[86] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development
of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek
to reassert royal authority.[87]

In 1774 the Spanish Navy ship _Santiago_ , under Juan Pérez had entered and
anchored in the inlet at Nootka Sound. Although the Spanish did not land,
natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from
California.[88] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade
between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese.
When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska
the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez's voyage being the
first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[89][fn 8]

After having arrived in the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed
north and then north-east to explore the west coast of North America north of
the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon
coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape
Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they
could begin their exploration of the coast northward.[91] In March 1778, Cook
landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet "King George's Sound". He recorded
that the native name was _Nutka_ or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his
conversations at _Friendly Cove/Yuquot_ ; his informant may have been
explaining that he was on an island ( _itchme nutka_ , a place you can "go
around"). There may also have been confusion with _Nuu-chah-nulth_ , the
natives' autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on
Cook's mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.[92]

#### Effects on and interaction with native populations

Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous
peoples of the Americas, and James Cook

_Death of Captain Cook_ by Johann Zoffany (1795)

With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the
contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and
displaced.[93] The native population of America declined after Europeans
arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and
measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among
Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected
specific tribes and various colonial settlements.[94][95][96][97][98][99]

In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food
shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were
also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their
colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to
depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for
guns, ammunition and other European wares.[100] Natives taught many settlers
where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries
and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Native Americans and urged
them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[101][102]

Captain James Cook's last voyage included sailing along the coast of North
America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine
months. He returned to the Hawaii to resupply, initially exploring the coasts
of Maui and the big island, trading with locals and then making anchor at
Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. When his ships and company left the islands, a
ship's mast broke in bad weather, forcing them to return in mid-February. Cook
would be killed days later.[103] [fn 9][fn 10]

### Independence and expansion (1776–1865)

Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of
Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United
States

_Declaration of Independence_ by John Trumbull

The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of
independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of
"republicanism" asserting that government rested on the will of the people as
expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as
Englishmen and "no taxation without representation". The British insisted on
administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into
war.[116]

Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the
actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress adopted the
Declaration of Independence on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble,
that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those
rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words
of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had
no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of
July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[117] The Second Continental
Congress declared on September 9 "where, heretofore, the words 'United
Colonies' have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the 'United
States' ".[118] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak
government that operated until 1789.[117]

Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their
defeat at Yorktown in 1781.[119] In the peace treaty of 1783, American
sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi
River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the
United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal
government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating
salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the
revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new
constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal
freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in
1791.[120]

Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in
1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in
the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[121][122][123] The
Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to
evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform
movements, including abolitionism;[124] in the South, Methodists and Baptists
proselytized among slave populations.[125]

Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American
Indian Wars.[126] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803
almost doubled the nation's area.[127] The War of 1812, declared against
Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S.
nationalism.[128] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to
cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[129] Expansion was aided by
steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water
systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M;
then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[130]

From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included
wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of
Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of
Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled
Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of
Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[131] The 1846
Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American
Northwest.[132] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848
Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American
Southwest.[133]

The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation
of additional western states.[134] After the American Civil War, new
transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded
internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[135] Over a
half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called "buffalo") was
an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[136] In 1869, a new Peace
Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and
secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several
of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[137]

The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the
United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy and
opportunity.[138]

### Civil War and Reconstruction Era

Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era

_TheBattle of Gettysburg_ by Thure de Thulstrup

Differences of opinion regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans
ultimately led to the American Civil War.[139] Initially, states entering the
Union had alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional
balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in
population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western
territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states
mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories,
whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[140]

With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the
largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states
ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America
(the "South"), while the federal government (the "Union") maintained that
secession was illegal.[140] In order to bring about this secession, military
action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind.
The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American
history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as
many civilians.[141] The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the
Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole.
Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his
Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's
viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately
won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was
required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery.

Three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the
war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment
providing citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had
been slaves,[142] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensuring in theory that African
Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a
substantial increase in federal power[143] aimed at reintegrating and
rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves.

Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln
attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the
former Confederacy, an assassin's bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge
between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it
their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of
African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877, when the
Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the
South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876.

Southern white Democrats, calling themselves "Redeemers", took control of the
South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called Jim Crow
laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region.
Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South.[144] They also
occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[145]

### Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization

Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and
industrial history of the United States

Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European
immigration[146]

In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from
Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's
industrialization and transformed its culture.[147] National infrastructure
including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and
greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later
invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication
and urban life.[148]

United States and its territories at their greatest extent from 1898 to 1902

The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical
cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[149] Mainland
expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[150] In
1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the
Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the
Spanish–American War.[151]

Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius
Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress
in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of
the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla
undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and
for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The
American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States
achieved great power status.[152] These dramatic changes were accompanied by
social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist
movements.[153] This period eventually ended with the advent of the
Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas,
including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods,
greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker
conditions.[154][155][156]

### World War I, Great Depression, and World War II

Crowd gathering on Wall Street after the 1929 crash

The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914,
until 1917 when it joined the war as an "associated power", alongside the
formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central
Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at
the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the
League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not
ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[157]

In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment
granting women's suffrage.[158] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for
mass communication and the invention of early television.[159] The prosperity
of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset
of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D.
Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the
Social Security system.[160] The Great Migration of millions of African
Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended
through the 1960s;[161] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished
many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[162]

At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much
of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the
Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the
Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the
United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[163] During the war,
the United States was referred as one of the "Four Policemen"[164] of Allies
power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union
and China.[165][166] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[167]
it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and
military influence.[168]

The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta
conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which
signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's
postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945
international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations
Charter, which became active after the war.[169] The United States developed
the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World
War II.[170][171] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as
Victory Day, or V-J Day.[172]

Germany on June 12, 1987.[173]

After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power
during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide
between capitalism and communism[174] and, according to the school of
geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental
Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S.
and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the
other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of
communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and
developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military
conflict.

The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as
Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean
forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[175] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of
the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned
spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States became the
first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[175] A proxy war in Southeast
Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.

At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth
of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway
System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades.
Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing
developments.[176][177] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state
added to the country.[178] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence
to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr.
becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions
and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end
racial discrimination.[179][180][181] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement
grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and
the sexual revolution.

The launch of a "War on Poverty" expanded entitlements and welfare spending,
including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide
health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested
Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[182]

The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in
1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-
market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned
"containment" and initiated the more aggressive "rollback" strategy towards
the USSR.[183][184][185][186][187] After a surge in female labor participation
over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were
employed.[188]

The late 1980s brought a "thaw" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse
in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[189][190][191][192] This brought about
unipolarity[193] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant
superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World
War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new
world order.

After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in
1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an
ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other
regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a
defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a
staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by
the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi
forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[194]

Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international
academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the
global economy, society, and culture.[195]

Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and
reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion
in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[196] Beginning in 1994, the U.S.
entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450
million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of
the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has
soared since NAFTA went into force.[197]

On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in
New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000
people.[198] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which
included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[199][200] In 2007, the
Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[201] which
successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the
region.[202][203]

Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[204] widespread
failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[205] and historically low
interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[206] led to the mid-2000s housing
bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic
contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression.[207] Barack
Obama, the first African American[208] and multiracial[209] president, was
elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[210] and subsequently passed stimulus
measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in
an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a
repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure
improvements[211] and a relative decline in unemployment.[212] Dodd-Frank
improved financial stability and consumer protection,[213] although there is
evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.[214]

In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, which made
the most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five
decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused
a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health
insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016,[215] but remains controversial
due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic
performance.[216] Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009,
voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The
Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the
House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in
2014.[217]

American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and
the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011.[218] The
withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency,[219] leading to the
rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in
the region.[220] In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic
relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[ _needs update_ ][221] The
next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development
of Iran's nuclear program.[222]

## Geography, climate, and environment

Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States,
and Environment of the United States

A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding
areas

Köppen climate classifications

The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles
(7,663,940.6 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by
Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2).
Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North
America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated
territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands,
and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[223]
Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia
and China, just ahead of Canada.[224]

The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area
(land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below
China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China
and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured:
calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055.0 km2)[225] to
3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091.5 km2)[226] to 3,796,742 square miles
(9,833,516.6 km2).[227]

The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to
deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[228] The Appalachian
Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands
of the Midwest.[229] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth
longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the
country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west,
interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[229]

The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to
south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m)
in Colorado.[230] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as
the Chihuahua and Mojave.[231] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges
run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than
14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United
States are in the state of California,[232] and only about 84 miles (135 km)
apart.[233] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (Mount
McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[234] Active
volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and
Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone
National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[235]
The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the
world.[236]

The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most
climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from
humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[237] The
Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western
mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin,
desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in
coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic
or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the
populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[238] Extreme weather
is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to
hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly
in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[239]

### Wildlife

Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States

See also: Category:Biota of the United States

The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since
1782.[240]

The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur
in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of
flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[241]
The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile
species, and 295 amphibian species.[242] About 91,000 insect species have been
described.[243] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal
of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[244]

There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks,
forests, and wilderness areas.[245] Altogether, the government owns about 28%
of the country's land area.[246] Most of this is protected, though some is
leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about
.86% is used for military purposes.[247][248]

Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970.
Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing
with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife,
logging and deforestation,[249][250] and international responses to global
warming.[251][252] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most
prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by
presidential order in 1970.[253] The idea of wilderness has shaped the
management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[254] The
Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and
endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service.[255]

1610–1780 population data.[257]  
Note that the census numbers do  
not include Native Americans until 1860.[258]  
  
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 323,425,550 as
of April 25, 2016, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or
about 6,646 people per day.[9] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during
the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[259] The third most populous
nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only
major industrialized nation in which large population increases are
projected.[260] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s
this number had decreased to 3.56.[261] Since the early 1970s the birth rate
has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in
2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its
rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20
million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the
population increase.[262] The foreign born population reached 45 million in
2015.[263][fn 11]

The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below
the world average.[267] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher
than that of many developed nations.[268] In fiscal year 2015, over one
million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were
granted legal residence.[269] Mexico has been the leading source of new
residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines
have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[270]
As of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal
immigrants.[271] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are
Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are
Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[263]

Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic,
non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012[272] and
over 50% of children under age one,[273][274] and are projected to constitute
the majority by 2044.[273]

According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million
Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as
homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[275][276] A 2016 Gallup poll also
concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest
percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state
was North Dakota at 1.7%.[277] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight,
while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being
bisexual.[278]

In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with
some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of
such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island
ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[279] The census counted more than 19
million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with any" of
its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are
of Hispanic ethnicity.[279]

The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are
officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million
Americans of Hispanic descent[279] are identified as sharing a distinct
"ethnicity" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican
descent.[280] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population
increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[281] Much of
this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was
foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[282][fn 12]

About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[227] about
half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[288] The US has
numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great
Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern
California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over
100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global
cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and
Houston).[289] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than
one million.[290] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or
South.[291] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and
Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[290]

### Language

endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the
United States

English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there
is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S.
naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million,
or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at
home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most
common language and the most widely taught second language.[294][295] Some
Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in
32 states.[296]

Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[297]
Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English.[298] While
neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of
both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[299] Other
states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of
certain government documents including court forms.[300]

Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native
languages, along with English: Samoan[301] and Chamorro[302] are recognized by
American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized
by the Northern Mariana Islands;[303] Spanish is an official language of
Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[304]

The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of
enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate studies,
are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German
(500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners)
include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[305][306] 18% of all
Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[307]

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of
religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.

Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but
other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said
that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher
figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[310] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42%
of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the
figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in
Mississippi.[311] Experts, researchers and authors have referred to the United
States as a "Protestant nation" or "founded on Protestant
principles,"[312][313][314][315] specifically emphasizing its Calvinist
heritage.[316][317][318]

As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious.
Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[319] Polls show that
overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the
mid to late 1980s,[320] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming
increasingly irreligious.[7][321] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant
share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as
religious category of the majority for the first time.[322][323] Americans
with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The
unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52%
of Christians.[324]

According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified
themselves as Christians;[325] Protestants accounted for 46.5% of them, while
Roman Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single religious group.[326] In
2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[326]
These include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), and Hinduism
(0.7%).[326] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described
themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in
1990.[326][327][328] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Scientologist,
Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan,
humanist and deist communities.[329]

Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United
States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively
form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%,[330] and the Southern
Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3%
of the U.S. population.[330] Lutheranism in the United States has its origin
in immigration from Scandinavia and Germany. North and South Dakota are the
only states where a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism
was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants.
Although it has expanded across the country, it is heavily concentrated on the
East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam
(New York City) before spreading westward. Other Protestant traditions with a
more dispersed membership include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists,
Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Holiness,
Adventists, Anabaptists, Christian fundamentalists, various Reformed,
Pietists, Quakers, and multiple others.[330] Roman Catholicism in the United
States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the
Americas, as well as in the English colony of Maryland.[331] It later grew
because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode
Island has the highest percentage of Catholics, with 40 percent of the total
population.[332] Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the
majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of
Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[333] Eastern Orthodoxy is claimed by 5% of people
in Alaska, a former Russian colony, and maintains a presence on the U.S.
mainland due to recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Finally, a number of
other Christian groups are active across the country, including the Jehovah's
Witnesses, Restorationists, Churches of Christ, Christian Scientists and many
others.

The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States
in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part
of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is
generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the
least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[311]

### Family structure

Main article: Family structure in the United States

As of 2007[update], 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were
widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[334] Women now
work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's
degrees.[335]

The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined
by 57% since 1991.[336] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in
Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[336][337] Abortion is legal throughout the
U.S., owing to _Roe v. Wade_ , a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court
of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio
of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged
15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[338] In 2013, the
average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried
women.[339]

The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per
woman.[340] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a
legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[341] In 2001, with
over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number
of adoptions worldwide.[342] Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is
legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the
U.S.[343]

the United States, Local government in the United States, and Elections in the
United States

The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a
representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority
rights protected by law".[344] The government is regulated by a system of
checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the
country's supreme legal document.[345] For 2016, the U.S. ranked 21st on the
Democracy Index[346] (tied with Italy) and 18th on the Corruption Perceptions
Index.[347]

In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three
levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties
are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all
cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of
citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal
level, and it is rare at lower levels.[348]

The federal government is composed of three branches:

  * Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[349] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[350]
  * Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[351]
  * Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[352]

The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a
congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among
the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states
had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous
state, had 53.[353]

The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-
large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every
other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the
office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by
an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are
apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[354] The Supreme
Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who
serve for life.[355]

The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska
uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[356] The governor (chief executive) of
each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are
appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected
by popular vote.

The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and
responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the
individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great writ" of
habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[357] the first ten
amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment
form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and
governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by
the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of
judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established
by the Supreme Court in _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803)[358] in a decision handed
down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[359]

The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five
territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[361] The states and
territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These
are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District
of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United
States, Washington DC.[362] The states and the District of Columbia choose the
President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to
the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress; the District of
Columbia has three.[363]

Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each
decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts
to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives
is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia
and the five major U.S. territories.[364]

The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian
nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American
Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of
the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great
deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make
war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[365]

United States

Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.[366]

Donald Trump  
45th President  
since January 20, 2017

Mike Pence  
48th Vice President  
since January 20, 2017

The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its
history.[367] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary
elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections.
Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic
Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the
Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president
Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of
the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the
Electoral College system.[368]

Within American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is
considered "conservative" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered
"liberal".[369][370] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of
the Great Lakes states, known as "blue states", are relatively liberal. The
"red states" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains
are relatively conservative.

Republican Donald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is
serving as the 45th President of the United States.[371] Leadership in the
Senate includes Republican Vice President Mike Pence, Republican President Pro
Tempore Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer.[372] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul
Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[373]

In the 115th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the
Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate consists of 52
Republicans, and 46 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the
Democrats; the House consists of 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats.[374] In
state governorships, there are 33 Republicans, 16 Democrats, and 1
Independent.[375] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there
are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[376]

### Foreign relations

Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of
the United States

The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[377]

The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is
home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[378] G20,
and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all
countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around
the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions.
However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not
have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S.
still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military
equipment).[379]

The United States has a "Special Relationship" with the United Kingdom[380]
and strong ties with Canada,[381] Australia,[382] New Zealand,[383] the
Philippines,[384] Japan,[385] South Korea,[386] Israel,[387] and several
European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It
works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and
with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade
agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with
Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on
official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of
America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of
0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving
by Americans is relatively generous.[388]

The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for
three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia,
the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of
the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War
II, which gained independence in subsequent years.[389]

On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a _In Defense of
Christians_ annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would
stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of
Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help
and aid Christians directly through the U.S. Agency for International
Development.[390] Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in
December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.[391][392]

###  Government finance

See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget

US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to
2013.[393]

Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local
government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales,
imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected
by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[394]
During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion
in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30
trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B
or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate
taxes ($242B or 10%).[395] Based on CBO estimates,[396] under 2013 tax law the
top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other
income groups will remain at historic lows.[397]

U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes,
and is among the most progressive in the developed
world.[398][399][400][401][402] The highest 10% of income earners pay a
majority of federal taxes,[403] and about half of all taxes.[404] Payroll
taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on
income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned
income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[405][406] The historic
reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement
programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[407][408] However,
according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security
is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings
quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system
progressive.[409]

The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with
13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[410] In 2013
the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for
the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and
−2.7% for the bottom quintile.[411][412] The incidence of corporate income tax
has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[401][413]
State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than
federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and
property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their
consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall
taxation.[401][414]

During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or
cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion.
Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or
23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or
19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%)
and interest ($223B or 6%).[395]

The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527
trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[415][fn 14]

### Military

Main article: United States Armed Forces

The carrier strike groups of the _Kitty Hawk_ , _Ronald Reagan_ , and _Abraham
Lincoln_ with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.

The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed
forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed
forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard
is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the
Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4
million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the
total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed
about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[420]

Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime
through the Selective Service System.[421] American forces can be rapidly
deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11
active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the
Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and
facilities abroad,[422] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty
personnel in 25 foreign countries.[423]

The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion,
41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national
military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-
highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[424] U.S.
defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according
to the CIA.[425] Defense's share of U.S. spending has generally declined in
recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of
federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in
2011.[426]

US global military presence.

The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a
4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the
military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[427] The last American troops
serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[428] 4,484 service members were
killed during the Iraq War.[429] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving
in Afghanistan in April 2012;[430] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed
during the War in Afghanistan.[431]

## Law enforcement and crime

States

See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States
Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system,
Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United
States

Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police
departments.[432]

Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local
police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader
services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the
country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting
civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and
federal laws.[433] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal
system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials;
federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals
from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very
common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea
bargain rather than jury trial.[434]

In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8
per cent increase, the largest since 1971.[435] The murder rate in 2015 was
4.9 per 100,000 people.[436] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with
17,250 murders that year.[437] The national clearance rate for homicides in
2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[438] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders
per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak
of 10.2 in 1980.[439] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of
violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other
developed nations.[440] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health
Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States "homicide
rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a
gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher."[441] Gun ownership rights
continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.

From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of
offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate
almost eight times that of whites ("whites" includes most Hispanics), and were
victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were
intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white
victims killed by whites.[442] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of
murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the
lowest.[443] The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246
violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over
9 million total crimes.[444]

Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and
military crimes, and used in 31 states.[445][446] No executions took place
from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down
arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that,
under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be
imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a
majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and
Oklahoma.[447] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down
death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of
executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia.[448]

The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total
prison population in the world.[449] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3
million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[450] In
December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about
6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States
was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest
rate observed since 1997.[451] The prison population has quadrupled since
1980,[452] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three
times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[453]
However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year
in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[454] and the rate
for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[455] The
country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing
guidelines and drug policies.[456] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons,
the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug
offenses.[457] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in
the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[458][459] In 2008, Louisiana had the
highest incarceration rate,[460] and Maine the lowest.[461]

United States export treemap (2011): The U.S. is the world's second-largest
exporter.

The United States has a capitalist mixed economy[470] which is fueled by
abundant natural resources and high productivity.[471] According to the
International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of
the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross
world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[472]

The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of
2014[update][473] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth
was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[474] The
country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita (first in the
Americas)[34][33] and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[472] The U.S. dollar is
the world's primary reserve currency.[475] The U.S. economy is also the
fastest growing in the Americas.[34][33]

The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest
exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total
U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[476] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and
Germany are its top trading partners.[477] In 2010, oil was the largest import
commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest
export.[476] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[478] The
largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal
government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the
debt.[479][480][481][482][fn 15]

In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy,
with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local
government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[485] The
number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in
manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[486] While its economy has reached a postindustrial
level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the
United States remains an industrial power.[487] The leading business field by
gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is
manufacturing.[488] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway
are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most
recognized soft drink company in the world.[489]

Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[490] The United States
is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest
importer.[491] It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear
energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The
National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that
include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and
others.[492][493]

Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[487] yet the United States is
the world's top producer of corn[494] and soybeans.[495] The National
Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products
that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay,
sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry,
pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of
genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech
crops.[496]

Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[497] In August
2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2
million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest
private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4
million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western
Europe.[498] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of
hiring and firing workers.[499] The United States is ranked among the top
three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare
state and redistributes less income through government action than European
nations tend to.[500]

The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its
workers paid vacation[501] and is one of just a few countries in the world
without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New
Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[502] While federal law does not require sick
leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees
at corporations.[503] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time
workers get the same benefits.[503] In 2009, the United States had the third-
highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and
Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and
the Netherlands.[504]

The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with
output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget
Office.[505] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but
remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the
continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal
bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising
petroleum and food prices.

### Income, poverty and wealth

A tract housing development in San Jose, California

Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United
States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita
income, and Income inequality in the United States

Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD
nations, and in 2007 had the second-highest median household
income.[506][507][508] According to the Census Bureau, median household income
was $59,039 in 2016.[509] Accounting for 4.4% of the global population,
Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world's total wealth,[510] and
Americans make up roughly half of the world's population of millionaires.[511]
The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food
affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[512] Americans on
average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as
European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[513] For 2013 the
United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187
countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted
HDI (IHDI).[514]

After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median
household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record
growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of
earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[509] There has been
a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[515]
However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide
because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[516] The rise
in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has
more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has
significantly affected income inequality,[517] leaving the United States with
one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[518] The top 1
percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from
2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government
transfers,[519] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of
debate.[520][ _disputed – discuss_][521]

**United States' families median net worth** source: Fed Survey of Consumer
Finances[522] in 2013 dollars | 1998 | 2013 | change  
---|---|---|---  
All families | $102,500 | $81,200 | -20.8%  
Bottom 20% of incomes | $8,300 | $6,100 | -26.5%

Top 10% | $646,600 | $1,130,700 | +74.9%  
  
Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the
adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the
bottom half claim only 2%.[523] According to a September 2017 report by the
Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in
2016.[524] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to
falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a
quarter of their value.[525] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007,
household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion
over 2006 levels.[526][527] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to
$11.8 trillion,[528] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[529]

There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the
U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter
or transitional housing program.[530] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in
food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of
U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating
patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[531]
According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults
lives in poverty, up from one in seven in 1980.[532] As of September 2017, 40
million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty,
with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty (a family income below one-
half of the poverty threshold). In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in
poverty, which made up 32.6% of the impoverished population.[533]

## Infrastructure

### Transportation

Main article: Transportation in the United States

The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[534]

Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a
network of 4 million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads,[535] including
one of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91700 km).[536]
The world's second-largest automobile market,[537] the United States has the
highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles
per 1,000 Americans.[538] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or
light trucks.[539] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and
non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47
km).[540]

Map showing current rail speeds in the United States.[541]

Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[542][543] Transport of
goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers
(approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly
because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S.
interior.[544][545] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity
passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[546] Also,
light rail development has increased in recent years.[547] Bicycle usage for
work commutes is minimal.[548]

The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely
deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[549] The
three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based;
American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[550]
Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States,
including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and
the fourth-busiest, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.[551] In the
aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security
Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners.

### Energy

Further information: Energy policy of the United States

The U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of
lines operated by approximately 500 companies. The North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees all of them.

The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[552]
Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per
year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came
from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was
supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[553] The United States
is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[554] The United States has 27%
of global coal reserves.[555] It is the world's largest producer of natural
gas and crude oil.[556]

For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other
developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a
1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were
filed.[557]

### Water supply and sanitation

Main article: Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States

Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the
West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the
affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce.
Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change
is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with
potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from
combined sewer overflows.[558][559][fn 16]

## Education

Main article: Education in the United States

The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the
many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded
education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately
funded institutions.

American public education is operated by state and local governments,
regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on
federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from
the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they
turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high
school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[562]

About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private
schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[563] The U.S. spends more
on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than
$11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school
student.[564] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public
universities.[565]

The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of
higher education. The majority of the world's top universities listed by
different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[566][567][568] There are also
local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter
academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6%
graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a
bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[569] The basic literacy
rate is approximately 99%.[227][570] The United Nations assigns the United
States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[571]

As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other
OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than
all nations in combined public and private spending.[564][572] As of
2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than
Americans owe on credit cards.[573]

## Culture

States, Culture of the Native Hawaiians, Social class in the United States,
Public holidays in the United States, and Tourism in the United States

The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic
groups, traditions, and values.[574][575] Aside from the Native American,
Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their
ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[576]
Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the
traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources,
such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[574][577] More recent
immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix
that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a
heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain
distinctive cultural characteristics.[574]

Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and
shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down
to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans
have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness,
and individualism,[578] as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed"
emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a
preference for limited government.[579] Americans are extremely charitable by
global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of
GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second
place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of
0.14%.[580][581]

The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social
mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[582] Whether this
perception is realistic has been a topic of
debate.[583][584][585][586][474][587] While mainstream culture holds that the
United States is a classless society,[588] scholars identify significant
differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization,
language, and values.[589] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and
cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually
close degree.[590] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic
achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive
attribute.[591]

### Food

Main article: Cuisine of the United States

Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.

Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries.
Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products
made of wheat flour[592] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as
turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which
were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[593] These home
grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most
popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to
celebrate the occasion.[594]

Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving
dinner.[595]

Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and
hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican
dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from
Italian sources are widely consumed.[596] Americans drink three times as much
coffee as tea.[597] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for
making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[598][599]

American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary
roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer
vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new
foods until accepted by Europeans.[600] Over time American foods changed to a
point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: _"Our founding fathers
were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their
food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence"_.[601]

The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[602] pioneered the
drive-through format in the 1940s.[603] Fast food consumption has sparked
health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose
24%;[596] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public
health officials call the American "obesity epidemic".[604] Highly sweetened
soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent
of American caloric intake.[605]

### Literature, philosophy, and the arts

Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the
United States, Visual art of the United States, and American classical music

Mark Twain, American author and humorist.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of
its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe,
and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by
the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major
figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown
during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[606] A
work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and
character—such as Herman Melville's _Moby-Dick_ (1851), Twain's _The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Great
Gatsby_ (1925) and Harper Lee's _To Kill a Mockingbird_ (1960)—may be dubbed
the "Great American Novel".[607]

Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob
Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often
named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[608] Popular
literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in
the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary
approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon,
and Don DeLillo.[609]

The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established
the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles
Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the
development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and
Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore
of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival
of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental
tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like
Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various
fields in social and political philosophy.[610][611]

In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in
the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins
are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an
exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the
U.S. art scene.[612] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others
experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such
as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the
pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United
States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to
American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank
Gehry.[613] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium
of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward
Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[614]

Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[615]

One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T.
Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841.
The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in
New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical
form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as
Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards.
Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other
acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee
Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[616]

Though little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established
him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while
experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive
American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin
developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.

Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance,
while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century
ballet.

### Music

Main article: Music of the United States

The Grammy Award is awarded to leading music artists.

The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply
influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European
traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known
as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global
audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke
Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and
rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[617]

Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and
roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of
America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of
funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American
pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global
celebrities,[617] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift,
Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z,
Eminem and Kanye West.[618] Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and
Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[619][620][621]

### Cinema

Main article: Cinema of the United States

The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California

Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the
leaders in motion picture production.[622] The world's first commercial motion
picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's
Kinetoscope.[623] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a
projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront
of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th
century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around
Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not
made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of
globalization.[624]

Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film
period, was central to the development of film grammar, and
producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie
merchandising.[625] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the
American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened
the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on
subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is
commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Hollywood", from the early sound
period until the early 1960s,[626] with screen actors such as John Wayne and
Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[627][628] In the 1970s, film directors
such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital
component in what became known as "New Hollywood" or the "Hollywood
Renaissance",[629] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist
pictures of the post-war period.[630] Since, directors such as Steven
Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their
blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in
return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron's _Avatar_ (2009)
earning more than $2 billion.[631]

Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson
Welles's _Citizen Kane_ (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film
of all time,[632][633] _Casablanca_ (1942), _The Godfather_ (1972), _Gone with
the Wind_ (1939), _Lawrence of Arabia_ (1962), _The Wizard of Oz_ (1939), _The
Graduate_ (1967), _On the Waterfront_ (1954), _Schindler's List_ (1993),
_Singin' in the Rain_ (1952), _It's a Wonderful Life_ (1946) and _Sunset
Boulevard_ (1950).[634] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars,
have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
since 1929,[635] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since
January 1944.[636]

###  Sports

Main article: Sports in the United States

Most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and
ice hockey[637]

American football is by several measures the most popular spectator
sport;[638] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average
attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by
millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since
the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league.
Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team
sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA)
and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played
professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of
the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[639] In
soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer
team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA
Women's World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest
league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams). The
market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion,
roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
combined.[640]

Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States (2028 Summer
Olympics will mark the ninth time). As of 2017, the United States has won
2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 282
in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[641] While most
major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball,
volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of
which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from
Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western
contact.[642] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing,
particularly NASCAR.[643][644] Rugby union is considered the fastest growing
sport in the U.S., with registered players numbered at 115,000+ and a further
1.2 million participants.[645]

### Media

Main article: Media of the United States

The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York
City

The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company
(NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company
(ABC), and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all
commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to
a variety of niches.[646] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely
commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[647]

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM
stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio
stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public
authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private
funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio
broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was
incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its
television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR
and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30,
2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S.
according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[648]

Well-known newspapers include _TheWall Street Journal_ , _TheNew York Times_ ,
and _USA Today_.[649] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the
years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers
to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire
service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world
coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are
privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which
own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful
of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or
families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the
mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's _The Village Voice_ or
Los Angeles' _LA Weekly_ , to name two of the best-known. Major cities may
also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local
industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of
the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing
in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics,
developed into an American icon.[650] Aside from web portals and search
engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!,
eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[651]

More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly
used language in the United States behind English.[652][653]

## Science and technology

and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon was triggered by the
Space Race.

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late
19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for
producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by
the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This
technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled
the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and
other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system
of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and
introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created
the system called mass production.[654]

In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the
telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind,
developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first
viable movie camera.[655] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide
entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of
Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright
brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air
powered flight.[656]

The rise of Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European
scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to
immigrate to the United States.[657] During World War II, the Manhattan
Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space
Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and
aeronautics.[658][659]

The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in
practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and
a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[660][661][662] This
in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions
around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by
American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and
Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include
Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and
popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to
meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of
networks which evolved into the Internet.[663]

These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for
individual use.[664] As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned at
least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[665] 91% of
Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013[update].[666] The United
States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[667]

In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development
funding comes from the private sector.[668] The United States leads the world
in scientific research papers and impact factor.[669]

## Health

States, and Health insurance in the United States

New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City is one of the world's busiest
hospitals. Pictured is the Weill Cornell facility (white complex at center).

The United States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2
years in 1990.[670][671][672] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand
places the United States 56th-lowest out of 224 countries.[673]

Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere
contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the
world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.[674] Obesity rates have more than doubled in
the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among
the highest anywhere.[675][676] Approximately one-third of the adult
population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[677] Obesity-
related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care
professionals.[678]

In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive
pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost
in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain,
and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious
risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure,
high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease,
drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years
of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[672] U.S. teenage
pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western
nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[679]

The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or
contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical
innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the
European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[680] Since 1966,
more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the
world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in
private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[681] The U.S.
health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita
spending and percentage of GDP.[682]

Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and
private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not
carry health insurance.[683] The subject of uninsured and underinsured
Americans is a major political issue.[684][685] In 2006, Massachusetts became
the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[686] Federal
legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal
health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its
ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[687][688]

There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[17]
  7. **^** The _Encyclopædia Britannica_ lists China as world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[19] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the United States is less than in the _CIA World Factbook_ because it _excludes_ coastal and territorial waters.[20]

The _CIA World Factbook_ lists the United States as the third-largest country
(after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,833,517 sq km,[21] and China as
fourth-largest at 9,596,960 sq km.[22] This figure for the United States is
greater than in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ because it _includes_ coastal
and territorial waters.

  8. **^** Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785–1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop this trade despite Spain's claims and navigation rights. The endeavours of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain's opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japan holding obdurately to national seclusion.[90]
  9. **^** His previous arrival coincided with the Makahiki,[104] a festival celebrating the Hawaiian deity Lono.[105] After the HMS  _Resolution_ and HMS  _Discovery_ had left the islands, the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the Hawaiian deity of war.[106]
  10. **^** On the evening of February 13, while anchored in Kealakekua Bay after their return, one of only two long boats was stolen.[107] The Hawaiians had begun to openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, Cook tried to take the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii, Kalaniʻōpuʻu as ransom for the boats.[108] The following morning of February 14, 1779[109] Cook and his men went directly to Kalaniʻōpuʻu's enclosure where the monarch was still sleeping.[110] One of ruler's wives, Kānekapōlei pleaded with them to stop.[111] Cook's men and the Marines were confronted on the beach by thousands of Native Hawaiians.[112] Cook tried to move the elderly man but he refused. As the townspeople began to surrounding them, Cook and his men raised their guns. Two chiefs and the monarch's wife shielded Kalaniʻōpuʻu as Cook tried to force him to his feet.[113] The crowd became hostile and Kanaʻina (one of the monarch's attendants) approached Cook, who reacted by striking him with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted him off his feet.[114] Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the ground as another attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed Cook to death.[115]
  11. **^** The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[264] German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[265][266] White Americans are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an _ethnic_ group, not a "racial" group), and third-largest ancestry group.[264] Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[264]
  12. **^** Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[283] Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[284] and over 50% of children under age one,[285] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[286] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[283] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[287]
  13. **^** Source: 2015 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau. Most respondents who speak a language other than English at home also report speaking English "well" or "very well" For the language groups listed above, the strongest English-language proficiency is among speakers of German (96% report that they speak English "well" or "very well"), followed by speakers of French (93.5%), Tagalog (92.8%), Spanish (74.1%), Korean (71.5%), Chinese (70.4%), and Vietnamese (66.9%).
