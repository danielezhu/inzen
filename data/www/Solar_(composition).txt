"Solar" (/ˈsoʊlər/ or /soʊˈlɑːr/) is a musical composition attributed to Miles Davis on the studio album Walkin' (1954), considered a modern jazz standard. The tune has been played and recorded by many musicians including his former bandmates/collaborators Lee Konitz, Bill Evans, Dave Holland, Keith Jarrett or Jack DeJohnette. A controversy exists over authorship of this composition; one current consensus holds that Davis' "Solar" is essentially an earlier song, "Sonny", written by Chuck Wayne. Dutch drummer and composer Pierre Courbois composed a tune called "RALOS" on the Solar chords in 7/4. The first two measures of this song adorn Miles Davis' tombstone in Woodlawn Cemetery.
