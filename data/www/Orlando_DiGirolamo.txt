Orlando DiGirolamo (April 20, 1924 â€“ January 26, 1998) was an American jazz accordionist, pianist, composer, and teacher. He is sometimes credited as "Lanny DiJay" on jazz recordings. DiGirolamo collaborated frequently with legendary jazz producer Teo Macero, and played on Macero's first commercial release, Explorations, also featuring Charles Mingus. He was described by Metronome magazine as an "extraordinary accordionist of the modern persuasion."
