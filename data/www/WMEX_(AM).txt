WMEX (1510 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve the Boston media market. Its programming is a mixture of libertarian and personality talk shows. It first began broadcasting in 1934 as WMEX, and after using various call signs since 1978, regained the original WMEX call sign on November 17, 2014.
The highly directional 50,000-watt signal of WMEX protects directional Class A, 50,000-watt, WLAC in Nashville (which also protects WMEX since the station pre-dated WLAC on the frequency).
