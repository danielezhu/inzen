The **City University of New York** ( **CUNY** ; pron.: /ˈkjuːni/) is the
public university system of New York City, and the largest urban university
system in the United States. CUNY and the State University of New York (SUNY)
are separate and independent university systems, despite the fact that both
public institutions receive funding from New York State. CUNY, however, is
only located in New York City, while SUNY is located in the entire state,
including New York City.

## Enrollment and demographics[edit]

CUNY is the third-largest university system in the United States, in terms of
enrollment, behind the State University of New York (SUNY), and the California
State University system. More than 270,000-degree-credit students, continuing,
and professional education students are enrolled at campuses located in all
five New York City boroughs.

The university has one of the most diverse student bodies in the United
States, with students hailing from 208 countries, but mostly from New York
City. The black, white and Hispanic undergraduate populations each comprise
more than a quarter of the student body, and Asian undergraduates make up 18
percent. Fifty-eight percent are female, and 28 percent are 25 or older.[7]

## History[edit]

### Founding[edit]

CUNY was created in 1961, by New York State legislation, signed into law by
Governor Nelson Rockefeller. The legislation integrated existing institutions
and a new graduate school into a coordinated system of higher education for
the city, under the control of the "Board of Higher Education of the City of
New York", which had been created by New York State legislation in 1926. By
1979, the Board of Higher Education had become the "Board of Trustees of the
CUNY".[11]

The institutions that were merged in order to create CUNY were:[11]

  * The Free Academy – Founded in 1847 by Townsend Harris, it was fashioned as "a Free Academy for the purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the city and county of New York." The Free Academy later became the City College of New York.
  * The Female Normal and High School – Founded in 1870, and later renamed the Normal College. It would be renamed again in 1914 to Hunter College. During the early 20th century, Hunter College expanded into the Bronx, with what became Herbert Lehman College.[11]
  * Brooklyn College – Founded in 1930.
  * Queens College – Founded in 1937.

### Accessible education[edit]

CUNY has served a diverse student body, especially those excluded from or
unable to afford private universities. Its four-year colleges offered a high
quality, tuition-free education to the poor, the working class and the
immigrants of New York City who met the grade requirements for matriculated
status. During the post-World War I era, when some Ivy League universities,
such as Yale University, discriminated against Jews, many Jewish academics and
intellectuals studied and taught at CUNY.[12] The City College of New York
developed a reputation of being "the Harvard of the proletariat."[13]

As New York City's population—and public college enrollment—grew during the
early 20th century and the city struggled for resources, the municipal
colleges slowly began adopting selective tuition, also known as instructional
fees, for a handful of courses and programs. During the Great Depression, with
funding for the public colleges severely constrained, limits were imposed on
the size of the colleges' free Day Session, and tuition was imposed upon
students deemed "competent" but not academically qualified for the day
program. Most of these "limited matriculation" students enrolled in the
Evening Session, and paid tuition.[14]

Demand in the United States for higher education rapidly grew after World War
II, and during the mid-1940s a movement began to create community colleges to
provide accessible education and training. In New York City, however, the
community-college movement was constrained by many factors including
"financial problems, narrow perceptions of responsibility, organizational
weaknesses, adverse political factors, and another competing priorities."[15]

Community colleges would have drawn from the same city coffers that were
funding the senior colleges, and city higher education officials were of the
view that the state should finance them. It wasn't until 1955, under a shared-
funding arrangement with New York State, that New York City established its
first community college, on Staten Island. Unlike the day college students
attending the city's public baccalaureate colleges for free, the community
college students had to pay tuition fees under the state-city funding formula.
Community college students paid tuition fees for approximately 10 years.[15]

Over time, tuition fees for limited-matriculated students became an important
source of system revenues. In fall 1957, for example, nearly 36,000 attended
Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and City Colleges for free, but another 24,000 paid
tuition fees of up to $300 a year – the equivalent of $2,413 in 2011.[16]
Undergraduate tuition and other student fees in 1957 comprised 17 percent of
the colleges' $46.8 million in revenues, about $7.74 million — a figure
equivalent to $62.4 million in 2011 buying power.[17]

Three community colleges had been established by early 1961, when New York
City's public colleges were codified by the state as a single university with
a chancellor at the helm and an infusion of state funds. But the city's
slowness in creating the community colleges as demand for college seats was
intensifying, had resulted in mounting frustration, particularly on the part
of minorities, that college opportunities were not available to them.

In 1964, as New York City's Board of Higher Education moved to take full
responsibility for the community colleges, city officials extended the senior
colleges' free tuition policy to them, a change that was included by Mayor
Robert Wagner in his budget plans and took effect with the 1964–65 academic
year.[18]

In 1969, a group of Black and Puerto Rican students occupied City College
demanding the racial integration of CUNY, which at the time had an
overwhelmingly white student body.[15]

### Student protests[edit]

Students at some campuses became increasingly frustrated with the university's
and Board of Higher Education's handling of university administration. At
Baruch College in 1967, over a thousand students protested the plan to make
the college an upper-division school limited to junior, senior, and graduate
students.[19] At Brooklyn College in 1968, students attempted a sit-in to
demand the admission of more black and Puerto Rican students and additional
black studies curriculum.[20] Students at Hunter College also demanded a Black
studies program.[21] Members of the SEEK program, which provided academic
support for underprepared and underprivileged students, staged a building
takeover at Queens College in 1969 to protest the decisions of the program's
director, who would later be replaced by a black professor.[22][23] Puerto
Rican students at Bronx Community College filed a report with the New York
State Division of Human Rights in 1970, contending that the intellectual level
of the college was inferior and discriminatory.[24] Hunter College was
crippled for several days by a protest of 2,000 students who had a list of
demands focusing on more student representation in college administration.[25]
Across CUNY, students boycotted their campuses in 1970 to protest a rise in
student fees and other issues, including the proposed (and later implemented)
open admissions plan.[26]

Like many college campuses in 1970, CUNY faced a number of protests and
demonstrations after the Kent State shootings and Cambodian Campaign. The
Administrative Council of the City University of New York sent U.S. President
Richard Nixon a telegram in 1970 stating, "No nation can long endure the
alienation of the best of its young people."[27] Some colleges, including John
Jay College of Criminal Justice, historically the "college for cops," held
teach-ins in addition to student and faculty protests.[28]

### Open admissions[edit]

In 1969, the Board of Trustees implemented a new admissions policy. The doors
to CUNY were opened wide to all those demanding entrance, assuring all high
school graduates entrance to the university without having to fulfill
traditional requirements such as exams or grades. This policy was known as
open admissions and nearly doubled the number of students enrolling in the
CUNY system to 35,000 (compared to 20,000 the year before). With greater
numbers came more diversity: Black and Hispanic student enrollment increased
threefold.[29] Remedial education, to supplement the training of under-
prepared students, became a significant part of CUNY's offerings.[30]

### Financial crisis of 1976[edit]

In fall 1976, during New York City's fiscal crisis, the free tuition policy
was discontinued under pressure from the federal government, the financial
community that had a role in rescuing the city from bankruptcy, and New York
State, which would take over the funding of CUNY's senior colleges.[31]
Tuition, which had been in place in the State University of New York system
since 1963, was instituted at all CUNY colleges.[32][33]

Meanwhile, CUNY students were added to the state's need-based Tuition
Assistance Program (TAP), which had been created to help private colleges.[34]
Full-time students who met the income eligibility criteria were permitted to
receive TAP, ensuring for the first time that financial hardship would deprive
no CUNY student of a college education.[34] Within a few years, the federal
government would create its own need-based program, known as Pell Grants,
providing the neediest students with a tuition-free college education. By
2011, nearly six of ten full- time undergraduates qualified for a tuition-free
education at CUNY due in large measure to state, federal and CUNY financial
aid programs.[35] CUNY's enrollment dipped after tuition was re-established,
and there were further enrollment declines through the 1980s and into the
1990s.[ _citation needed_ ]

### Financial crisis of 1995[edit]

In 1995, CUNY suffered another fiscal crisis when Governor George Pataki
proposed a drastic cut in state financing.[36] Faculty cancelled classes and
students staged protests. By May, CUNY adopted deep cuts to college budgets
and class offerings.[37] By June, in order to save money spent on remedial
programs, CUNY adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges:
students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, this a departure
from the 1970 Open Admissions program.[38] That year's final state budget cut
funding by $102 million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and
offering a retirement incentive plan for faculty.

In 1999, a task force appointed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued a report that
described CUNY as "an institution adrift" and called for an improved, more
cohesive university structure and management, as well as more consistent
academic standards. Following the report, Matthew Goldstein, a mathematician
and City College graduate who had led CUNY's Baruch College and briefly,
Adelphi University, was appointed chancellor. CUNY ended its policy of open
admissions to its four-year colleges, raised its admissions standards its most
selective four-year colleges (Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens), and
required new-enrollees who needed remediation, to begin their studies at a
CUNY open-admissions community colleges.[39]

### 2010 onwards[edit]

CUNY's enrollment of degree-credit students reached 220,727 in 2005 and
262,321 in 2010 as the university broadened its academic offerings.[40] The
university added more than 2,000 full-time faculty positions, opened new
schools and programs, and expanded the university's fundraising efforts to
help pay for them.[39] Fundraising increased from $35 million in 2000 to more
than $200 million in 2012.[41]

As of Autumn 2013, all CUNY undergraduates are required to take an
administration-dictated common core of courses which have been claimed to meet
specific "learning outcomes" or standards. Since the courses are accepted
University wide, the administration claims it will be easier for students to
transfer course credits between CUNY colleges. It also reduced the number of
core courses some CUNY colleges had required, to a level below national norms,
particularly in the sciences.[42][43] The program is the target of several
lawsuits by students and faculty, and was the subject of a "no confidence"
vote by the faculty, who rejected it by an overwhelming 92% margin.[44]

Chancellor Goldstein retired on July 1, 2013, and was replaced on June 1, 2014
by James Milliken, president of the University of Nebraska, and a graduate of
University of Nebraska and New York University Law School.[45]

Seal of the CUNY Board of Trustees

The forerunner of today's City University of New York was governed by the
Board of Education of New York City. Members of the Board of Education,
chaired by the President of the board, served as _ex officio_ trustees. For
the next four decades, the board members continued to serve as _ex officio_
trustees of the College of the City of New York and the city's other municipal
college, the Normal College of the City of New York.

In 1900, the New York State Legislature created separate boards of trustees
for the College of the City of New York and the Normal College, which became
Hunter College in 1914. In 1926, the Legislature established the Board of
Higher Education of the City of New York, which assumed supervision of both
municipal colleges.

In 1961, the New York State Legislature established the City University of New
York, uniting what had become seven municipal colleges at the time: the City
College of New York, Hunter College, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Staten
Island Community College, Bronx Community College and Queensborough Community
College. In 1979, the CUNY Financing and Governance Act was adopted by the
State and the Board of Higher Education became the City University of New York
Board of Trustees.

Today, the City University is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of 17
members, ten of whom are appointed by the Governor of New York "with the
advice and consent of the senate," and five by the Mayor of New York City
"with the advice and consent of the senate." The final two trustees are _ex
officio_ members. One is the chair of the university's student senate, and the
other is non-voting and is the chair of the university's faculty senate. Both
the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to
include at least one resident of each of New York City's five boroughs.
Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years.
The Chancellor is elected by the Board of Trustees, and is the "chief
educational and administrative officer" of the City University.

The administrative offices are in mid-town Manhattan.[46]

## Public Safety Department[edit]

Main article: City University of New York Public Safety Department

CUNY has its own public safety force whose duties are to protect and serve all
students and faculty members, and enforce all state and city laws at all of
CUNY's universities. The force has more than 1000 officers, making it one of
the largest public safety forces in New York City.

The Public Safety Department came under heavy criticism, from student groups,
after several students protesting tuition increases tried to occupy the lobby
of the Baruch College. The occupiers were forcibly removed from the area and
several were arrested on November 21, 2011.[47]

## City University Television (CUNY TV)[edit]

CUNY also has a broadcast TV service, CUNY TV (channel 75 on Time Warner
cable, digital HD broadcast channel 25.3), which airs telecourses, classic and
foreign films, magazine shows and panel discussions in foreign languages.

## City University Film Festival (CUFF)[edit]

CUFF is CUNY's official film festival. The festival was founded in 2009 by
Hunter College student Daniel Cowen.
