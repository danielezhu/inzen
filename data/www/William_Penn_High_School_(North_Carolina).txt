William Penn High School, also known as High Point Normal & Industrial Institute, is a historic high school for African-American students located at High Point, Guilford County, North Carolina. The high school building was built in 1910-1911, and enlarged and renovated in 1929-1930. It is a two-story, 12 classroom Colonial Revival style brick building. It has a projecting three-bay entrance pavilion. Two other buildings associated with the High Point Normal & Industrial Institute are on the property. The Institute was established by Quakers in 1891. They were built about 1910 and are a gable end frame structure sheathed in corrugated metal with a distinctive monitor roof and a brick building with a low pitched roof. The school closed in 1968.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
