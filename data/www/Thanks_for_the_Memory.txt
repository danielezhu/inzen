"Thanks for the Memory" (1938) is a popular song, with music composed by Ralph Rainger and lyrics by Leo Robin. It was introduced in the 1938 film The Big Broadcast of 1938 by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross, and recorded by Shep Fields and His Orchestra with vocals by Bob Goday. Dorothy Lamour's solo recording of the song was also popular, and has led to many mistakenly believing over the years that it was she, and Hope, who sang the tune in the film (in which Lamour also appeared).
In the film, Ross and Hope's characters are a divorced couple who encounter each other aboard a ship. Near the film's end they poignantly sing one of the many versions of this song, recalling the ups and downs of their relationship (then they decide to get back together).
The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became Hope's signature tune, with many different lyrics adapted to any situation. In 2004 it finished #63 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.
The song is often regarded as a companion piece to "Two Sleepy People", written in September 1938 by Hoagy Carmichael with lyrics by Frank Loesser, also performed by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross in the movie Thanks for the Memory which appeared in 1939, taking its title from the success of the song.
