The Yale-Myers Forest is a 7,800-acre (32 km²) forest in Northeastern Connecticut owned by Yale University and administered by the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. Located in the towns of Union, Ashford, Eastford, and Woodstock , the forest is reputed to be the largest private landholding in the state.
The Yale-Myers Forest is managed according to a philosophy of multiple uses, with scientific research and teaching balanced with commercial timber production. The forest is traversed by the hiking path known as the Nipmuck Trail; this route is the only public access allowed except for permitted hunting in season.
The Yale-Myers Forest is a component of the Yale Forests system, which also includes the 1,100-acre (4.5 km²) Yale-Toumey Forest in the towns of Swanzey and Keene in New Hampshire, and the 462-acre (1.9 km²) Bowen Forest in Mount Holly, Vermont.
Boston Hollow is part of the Yale-Myers Forest.
