The Belgian Entertainment Association (BEA) is the organization that represents the interests of the music, video and video game industries in Belgium. It was founded in February 2008, when three organizations merged, namely IFPI Belgium, the local chapter of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represented the music industry, the Belgian Video Federation (BVF), which represented the video industry, and the Belgian Luxembourg Interactive Software Association (BLISA), which represented the video game industry. BEA is listed as the local record industry association in Belgium by the IFPI.
