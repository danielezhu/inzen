## Early life[edit]

He was born in Winona, Minnesota and grew up in Minneapolis. He received a
B.S. from the University of Minnesota in 1943, then joined the U.S. Navy. On
the G.I. Bill he earned his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University
following World War II. At Columbia, however, he became a specialist in
statistics as well. He taught briefly at City College of New York, then took a
position in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948 to teach
statistics in accounting and auditing.

## Carnegie Mellon years[edit]

Cyert taught economics, statistics, and industrial administration for the next
14 years, then was named dean of the Graduate School of Industrial
Administration. In 1972 he became the university's sixth president. During his
tenure as president, he led Carnegie Mellon through unparalleled growth,
transforming it from an Eastern technical school to a premiere American
university and focused the university on computer studies.[2] He faced
inherited deficits by first cutting costs, which gained him some enemies, and
later launched the largest expansion in the school's 98-year history. The
number of departments and programs ranked in the Top 10 nationally by deans'
surveys rose from three—computer science, drama, and industrial
administration—to twelve. His administration initiated new program areas in
urban and public policy, engineering, architecture, art, cognitive psychology,
social history, philosophy, and applied math.

Throughout his administrative career he remained active in his academic
fields. He was the author or co-author of 12 books and wrote more than 100
articles for professional journals and books. In 1973 he was elected as a
Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[3]

After retiring from CMU, Cyert served as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees
of the National Institute of Statistical Sciences at Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina. He served for four years, until illness forced him to step
down. He died following a long battle with cancer.

For 52 years he was married to Margaret Shadick Cyert; they had three
daughters.

Cyert Hall, Carnegie Mellon's computing administration building, is named
after Richard Cyert.
