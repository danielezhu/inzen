Miles in Tokyo is a live album recorded on July 14, 1964, by the Miles Davis Quintet at the Kohseinenkin Hall, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. It was released in the United States on CD in 2005 and is the first recording of Davis in Japan. It is the only album to showcase an early incarnation of his Second Great Quintet featuring Sam Rivers on tenor saxophone, following George Coleman's departure; after this, Wayne Shorter's appointment completed the classic lineup which recorded such albums as ESP and Miles Smiles, through to Miles in the Sky.
