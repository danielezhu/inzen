**Schenley Park** (Pronounced "Shen lee") is a large municipal park located in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between the neighborhoods of Oakland, Greenfield,
and Squirrel Hill. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic
Places as a historic district.[3][4] In 2011, the park was named one of
"America's Coolest City Parks" by _Travel + Leisure_.[5]

The park is made up of 300 acres (120 ha) donated by Mary Schenley in 1889 and
another 120 acres (49 ha) that the city subsequently purchased from her.
Another 36 acres (15 ha) were acquired at a later date, bringing the park's
total size to 456 acres (185 ha), and making it the second largest municipal
park in Pittsburgh, behind Frick Park.

The park borders the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University
of Pittsburgh.

## Facilities[edit]

Schenley Park features a grand entrance, Schenley Plaza, and several miles of
hiking trails and a large lake in Panther Hollow. Across from the Phipps
Conservatory & Botanical Gardens is Flagstaff Hill, a popular place to watch
outdoor movies in the summer.

In the early days of Schenley Park, the area known as "The Oval" was used for
horse racing. Today, it has 13 tennis courts, an all weather running track,
and a soccer field. There is also an ice skating rink, public swimming pool,
and an 18-hole disc golf course nearby.

Schenley Park also contains the Schenley Park Golf Course. The golf course
includes an indoor practice facility where golfers can play a "virtual" round
on Pebble Beach and other famous courses.

## Annual events[edit]

Since 1983, Schenley Park has been home to a vintage motor sports car race,
the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, that takes place annually in mid-July.
Additionally, since 1993, the park has been home to the Komen Pittsburgh Race
for the Cure, an annual fundraising event for breast cancer and Mother's Day
tradition with more than 35,000 participants.[6] Carnegie Mellon University's
annual Spring Carnival contests its Sweepstakes, a buggy race, on Tech Avenue,
Schenley Drive, and Frew Street.

## History[edit]

Neill Log House in Schenley Park, built circa 1787 (or before), once belonged
to the family of Robert Neill, and later to Col. James O'Hara and his
granddaughter Mary Schenley (for whom the park is named).

In 1842, Mary Elizabeth Croghan of Pittsburgh, who was 15 at the time, eloped
with 43-year-old Captain Edward Schenley. The couple moved to England. Mary's
father attempted to terminate her inheritance in a lawsuit, but was
unsuccessful. Mary's maternal grandfather, General James O'Hara, bequeathed to
her a parcel of land known as the "Mt. Airy Tract."

Mary's wealth attracted the attention of several land developers in the
Pittsburgh area as well as Edward Bigelow, the Director of the Department of
Public Works in Pittsburgh. In 1889, Bigelow learned that the agent of a land
developer planned to travel to London to attempt to purchase the land from
Mary. Bigelow sent an East Liberty lawyer by train to New York City where he
then boarded a steamer bound for England. The lawyer beat the real estate
agent by two days.

After negotiations with Mary, Bigelow's lawyer entered into an agreement to
give 300 acres (1.21 km²) of the Mt. Airy Tract to the city of Pittsburgh with
an option to purchase 120 (0.49 km²) more, under the conditions that the park
be named after her and never be sold. The city agreed and immediately
purchased the additional 120 acres (0.49 km²) of land.

Bigelow began to develop the newly renamed Schenley Park for recreational
uses. He hired William Falconer to lead the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical
Gardens which was built in 1893. In 1895, Andrew Carnegie built the Carnegie
Museum and Music Hall, establishing Oakland and Schenley Park as a cultural
icon.

Forbes Field, the home field of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was adjacent to
Schenley Park during its lifespan (1909–1970).

### Recent developments[edit]

  * In 2001, after extensive renovations, the Schenley Park Visitor Center opened in one of the park's original buildings. The building had previously served as a tool shed, the home of the Pittsburgh Civic Garden Center, and a nature museum, until closing in the late 1980s.
  * In spring 2006, the Schenley Plaza area was converted to its original use as a grand entrance to Schenley Park. Although it was originally designed as a grand entrance, it had been used as a parking lot for many years. The new park area features a carousel and several small food stands.
