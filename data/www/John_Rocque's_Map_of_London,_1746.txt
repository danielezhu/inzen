John Rocque's Map of London, 1746, more formally "A plan of the cities of London and Westminster, and borough of Southwark", surveyed by John Rocque and engraved by John Pine, is a map of Georgian London to a scale of 26 inches to a mile. The map consists of twenty-four sheets and is 3.84 by 2.01 metres in overall size. Taking nearly ten years to survey, engrave and publish, it has been described as "a magnificent example of cartography ... one of the greatest and most handsome plans of any city".
