Barnard College is a private women's liberal arts college in New York City. Founded in 1889 as a response to Columbia University's refusal to admit women into their institution, it is one of the oldest women's colleges in the world, and the only women's college in New York City today. It has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1900.
The school was founded by Annie Nathan Meyer and named after Frederick Barnard, tenth president of Columbia. When Columbia became coeducational in 1983 Barnard elected to remain legally and financially separate but maintained its affiliated relationship with the university. This includes shared academic programs and other academic privileges, and a combined athletic program. Barnard students also receive Columbia University degrees and graduate at Columbia University graduation. Barnard confers the Bachelor of Arts degree in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at the Juilliard School and The Jewish Theological Seminary.
Barnard's 4-acre (1.6 ha) campus is located in the Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights, stretching along Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets. It is directly across from Columbia's campus and near several other academic institutions. The college is a member of the Seven Sisters, an association of seven prominent women's liberal arts colleges.
