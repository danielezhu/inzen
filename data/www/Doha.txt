**Doha** (Arabic:  الدوحة‎, _ad-Dawḥa_ or _ad-Dōḥa_ , pronounced [addawħa],[
_stress?_ ] literally in MSA: "the big tree", locally: "rounded bays")[2] is
the capital city and most populous city of the State of Qatar. Doha has a
population of 1,351,000 in a city proper with the population close to 1.5
million.[1] The city is located on the coast of the Persian Gulf in the east
of the country. It is Qatar's fastest growing city, with over 50% of the
nation's population living in Doha or its surrounding suburbs, and it is also
the economic centre of the country.

Doha was founded in the 1820s as an offshoot of Al Bidda. It was officially
declared as the country's capital in 1971, when Qatar gained independence from
being a British Protectorate.[3] As the commercial capital of Qatar and one of
the emergent financial centres in the Middle East, Doha is considered a world
city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Doha accommodates
Education City, an area devoted to research and education.

The city was host to the first ministerial-level meeting of the Doha
Development Round of World Trade Organization negotiations. It was also
selected as host city of a number of sporting events, including the 2006 Asian
Games, the 2011 Pan Arab Games and most of the games at the 2011 AFC Asian
Cup. In December 2011, the World Petroleum Council held the 20th World
Petroleum Conference in Doha.[4] Additionally, the city hosted the 2012 UNFCCC
Climate Negotiations and is set to host a large number of the venues for the
2022 FIFA World Cup.

In May 2015, Doha was officially recognized as one of the New7Wonders Cities
together with Vigan, La Paz, Durban, Havana, Beirut and Kuala Lumpur.[5]

## Etymology[edit]

The name "Doha" may have originated from the Arabic _Ad-Dawḥa_ , "the big
tree".[6] The reference might be to a prominent tree that stood at the site
where the original fishing village arose, on the eastern coast of the Qatar
peninsula. Alternatively, it may have been derived from "dohat" — Arabic for
bay or gulf — referring to the Doha Bay area surrounding the Corniche.[2]

## History[edit]

### Establishment of Al Bidda[edit]

The city of Doha was formed after seceding from another local settlement known
as Al Bidda. The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681, by
the Carmelite Convent, in an account which chronicles several settlements in
Qatar. In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are
alluded to.[7][8] Carsten Niebuhr, a German explorer who visited the Arabian
Peninsula, created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765 in
which he labelled it as 'Guttur'.[7][9]

David Seaton, a British political resident in Muscat, wrote the first English
record of Al Bidda in 1801. He refers to the town as 'Bedih' and describes the
geography and defensive structures in the area.[10] He stated that the town
had recently been settled by the Sudan tribe (Al-Suwaidi), whom he considered
to be pirates. Seaton attempted to bombard the town with his warship, but
returned to Muscat upon finding that the waters were too shallow to position
his warship within striking distance.[11][12]

In 1820, British surveyor R.H. Colebrook, who visited Al Bidda, remarked on
the recent depopulation of the town. He wrote:[11][13]

> _Guttur – Or Ul Budee [Al‐Bidda], once a considerable town, is protected by
two square Ghurries [forts] near the sea shore; but containing no fresh water
they are incapable of defence except against sudden incursions of Bedouins,
another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This
could contain two hundred men. There are remaining at Ul Budee about 250 men,
but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will
augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the
place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men._

The same year, an agreement known as the General Maritime Treaty was signed
between the East India Company and the sheikhs of several Persian Gulf
settlements (some of which were later known as the Trucial Coast). It
acknowledged British authority in the Persian Gulf and sought to end piracy
and the slave trade. Bahrain became a party to the treaty, and it was assumed
that Qatar, perceived as a dependency of Bahrain by the British, was also a
party to it.[14] Qatar, however, was not asked to fly the prescribed Trucial
flag.[15] As punishment for alleged piracy committed by the inhabitants of Al
Bidda and breach of treaty, an East India Company vessel bombarded the town in
1821. They razed the town, forcing between 300 and 400 natives to flee and
temporarily take shelter on the islands between the Qatar and the Trucial
Coast.[16]

### Formation of Doha[edit]

Doha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s.[17] In
January 1823, political resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with
the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the
chief of the Al-Buainain tribe.[17][18] MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the
only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time. Following the
founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the
extremely close proximity of the two settlements.[17] Later that year, Lt. Guy
and Lt. Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements. Despite
being mapped as two separate entities, they were referred to under the
collective name of Al Bidda in the written description.[19][20]

In 1828, Mohammed bin Khamis, a prominent member of the Al-Buainain tribe and
successor of Buhur bin Jubrun as chief of Al Bidda, was embroiled in
controversy. He had murdered a native of Bahrain, prompting the Al Khalifa
sheikh to imprison him. In response, the Al-Buainain tribe revolted, provoking
the Al Khalifa to destroy the tribe's fort and evict them to Fuwayrit and Ar
Ru'ays. This incident allowed the Al Khalifa additional jurisdiction over the
town.[21][22] With essentially no effective ruler, Al Bidda and Doha became a
sanctuary for pirates and outlaws.[23]

In November 1839, an outlaw from Abu Dhabi named Ghuleta took refuge in Al
Bidda, evoking a harsh response from the British. A.H. Nott, a British naval
commander, demanded that Salemin bin Nasir Al-Suwaidi, chief of the Sudan
tribe in Al Bidda, take Ghuleta into custody and warned him of consequences in
the case of non-compliance. Al-Suwaidi obliged the British request in February
1840 and also arrested the pirate Jasim bin Jabir and his associates. Despite
the compliance, the British demanded a fine of 300 German krones in
compensation for the damages incurred by pirates off the coast of Al Bidda;
namely for the piracies committed by bin Jabir. In February 1841, British
naval squadrons arrived in Al Bidda and ordered Al-Suwaidi to meet the British
demand, threatening consequences if he declined. Al-Suwaidi ultimately
declined on the basis that he was uninvolved in bin Jabir's actions. On 26
February, the British fired on Al Bidda, striking a fort and several houses.
Al-Suwaidi then paid the fine in full following threats of further action by
the British.[23][24]

Isa bin Tarif, a powerful tribal chief from the Al Bin Ali tribe, moved to
Doha in May 1843. He subsequently evicted the ruling Sudan tribe and installed
the Al-Maadeed and Al-Kuwari tribes in positions of power.[25] Bin Tarif had
been loyal to the Al Khalifa, however, shortly after the swearing in of a new
ruler in Bahrain, bin Tarif grew increasingly suspicious of the ruling Al
Khalifa and switched his allegiance to the deposed ruler of Bahrain, Abdullah
bin Khalifa, whom he had previously assisted in deposing of. Bin Tarif died in
the Battle of Fuwayrit against the ruling family of Bahrain in 1847.[25]

### Arrival of Al Thani[edit]

The Al Thani migrated to Doha from Fuwayrit shortly after Bin Tarif's death in
1847 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani.[26][27] In the proceeding
years, the Al Thani assumed control of the town. At various times, they
swapped allegiances between the two prevailing powers in the area: the Al
Khalifa and the Saudis.[26]

In 1867, a large number of ships and troops were sent from Bahrain to assault
the towns Al Wakrah and Doha over a series of disputes. Abu Dhabi joined on
Bahrain's behalf due to the conception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for
fugitives from Oman. Later that year, the combined forces sacked the two
Qatari towns with around 2,700 men in what would come to be known as the
Qatari–Bahraini War.[28][29] A British record later stated _"that the towns of
Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence,
the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported"_.[30]

Doha in January 1904

The joint Bahraini-Abu Dhabi incursion and subsequent Qatari counterattack
prompted the British political agent, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to impose a
settlement in 1868. Pelly's mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the peace treaty
that resulted were milestones in Qatar's history. It implicitly recognized the
distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of
Mohammed bin Thani as an important representative of the peninsula's
tribes.[31]

Doha's coastline in 1904

Shortly after the war, the Ottomans took up a rather nominal control of the
country, constructing a base in Doha, with the acquiescence of Jassim Al Thani
who wished to consolidate his control of the area. Prior to this, the town of
Doha served as a stronghold for Bedouin fighters who resisted Ottoman
rule.[32] By December 1871, Jassim Al Thani authorized the Ottomans to send
100 troops and equipment to Al Bidda.[33] Major Ömer Bey compiled a report on
Al Bidda in January 1872, stating that it was an "administrative centre" with
around 1,000 houses and 4,000 inhabitants.[34]

Disagreement over tribute and interference in internal affairs arose,
eventually leading to the Battle of Al Wajbah in March 1893. Al Bidda fort
served as the final point of retreat for Ottoman troops. While they were
garrisoned in the fort, their corvette fired indiscriminately at the
townspeople, killing a number of civilians.[35] The Ottomans eventually
surrendered after Jassim Al Thani's troops cut off the town's water
supply.[36] An Ottoman report compiled the same year reported that Al Bidda
and Doha had a combined population of 6,000 inhabitants, jointly referring to
both towns by the name of 'Katar'. Doha was classified as the eastern section
of Katar.[34][37] The Ottomans held a passive role in Qatar's politics from
the 1890s onward until fully relinquishing control during the beginning of the
first World War.[14]

### 20th century[edit]

An old district in Doha.

Pearling had come to play a pivotal commercial role in Doha by the 20th
century. The population increased to around 12,000 inhabitants in the first
half of the 20th century due to the flourishing pearl trade.[38] A British
political resident noted that should the supply of pearls drop, Qatar would
'practically cease to exist'.[39] In 1907, the city accommodated 350 pearling
boats with a combined crew size of 6,300 men. By this time, the average prices
of pearls had more than doubled since 1877.[40] The pearl market collapsed
that year, forcing Jassim Al Thani to sell the country's pearl harvest at half
its value. The aftermath of the collapse resulted in the establishment of the
country's first custom house in Doha.[39]

In April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all
their troops from Qatar. Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in
August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the
start of World War I.[41] One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British
protectorate with Doha as its official capital.[42][43]

Buildings at the time were simple dwellings of one or two rooms, built from
mud, stone and coral. Oil concessions in the 1920s and 1930s, and subsequent
oil drilling in 1939, heralded the beginning of slow economic and social
progress in the country. However, revenues were somewhat diminished due to the
devaluation of pearl trade in the Persian Gulf brought on by introduction of
the cultured pearl and the Great Depression.[44] The collapse of the pearl
trade caused a significant population drop throughout the entire country.[38]
It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the country saw significant monetary
returns from oil drilling.[14]

Doha in the 1980s.

Qatar was not long in exploiting the new-found wealth from oil concessions,
and slum areas were quickly razed to be replaced by more modern buildings. The
first formal boys' school was established in Doha in 1952, followed three
years later by the establishment of a girls' school.[45] Historically, Doha
had been a commercial port of local significance. However, the shallow water
of the bay prevented bigger ships from entering the port until the 1970s, when
its deep-water port was completed. Further changes followed with extensive
land reclamation, which led to the development of the crescent-shaped bay.[46]
From the 1950s to 1970s, the population of Doha grew from around 14,000
inhabitants to over 83,000, with foreign immigrants constituting about two-
thirds of the overall population.[47]

### Post-independence[edit]

Qatar officially declared its independence in 1971, with Doha as its capital
city.[3] In 1973, the University of Qatar was opened by emiri decree,[48] and
in 1975 the Qatar National Museum opened in what was originally the ruler's
palace.[49] During the 1970s, all old neighborhoods in Doha were razed and the
inhabitants moved to new suburban developments, such as Al Rayyan, Madinat
Khalifa and Al Gharafa. The metropolitan area's population grew from 89,000 in
the 1970s to over 434,000 in 1997. Additionally, land policies resulted in the
total land area increasing to over 7,100 hectares by 1995, an increase from
130 hectares in the middle of the 20th century.[50]

Recent developments in Doha.

In 1983, a hotel and conference center was developed at the north end of the
Corniche. The 15-storey Sheraton hotel structure in this center would serve as
the tallest structure in Doha until the 1990s.[50] In 1993, the Qatar Open
became the first major sports event to be hosted in the city.[51] Two years
later, Qatar stepped in to host the FIFA World Youth Championship, with all
the matches being played in Doha-based stadiums.[52]

Doha's West Bay area in 2015.

The Al Jazeera Arabic news channel began broadcasting from Doha in 1996.[53]
In the late 1990s, the government planned the construction of Education City,
a 2,500 hectare Doha-based complex mainly for educational institutes.[54]
Since the start of the 21st century, Doha attained significant media attention
due to the hosting of several global events and the inauguration of a number
of architectural mega-projects.[55] One of the largest projects launched by
the government was The Pearl-Qatar, an artificial island off the coast of West
Bay, which launched its first district in 2004.[56] In 2006, Doha was selected
to host the Asian Games, leading to the development of a 250-hectare sporting
complex known as Aspire Zone.[51] During this time, new cultural attractions
were constructed in the city, with older ones being restored. In 2006, the
government launched a restoration program to preserve Souq Waqif's
architectural and historical identity. Parts constructed after the 1950s were
demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was
completed in 2008.[57] Katara Cultural Village was opened in the city in 2010
and has hosted the Doha Tribeca Film Festival since then.[58]

## Geography[edit]

Doha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian
Gulf on its coast. Its elevation is 10 m (33 ft).[59] Doha is highly
urbanized. Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and
30 km of coastline.[60] Half of the 22 km² of surface area which Hamad
International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land.[61] The geology
of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the
Eocene period Dammam Formation, forming dolomitic limestone.[62]

The Pearl, a man-made island off the coast of Doha.

The Pearl is an artificial island in Doha with a surface area of nearly 400 ha
(1,000 acres)[63] The total project has been estimated to cost $15 billion
upon completion.[64] Other islands off Doha's coast include Palm Tree Island,
Shrao's Island, Al Safia Island, and Alia Island.[65]

### Climate[edit]

Doha has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification _BWh_ ). Summer
is very long, from May to September, when its average high temperatures
surpass 38 °C (100 °F) and often approach 45 °C (113 °F). Humidity is usually
the lowest in May and June. Dewpoints can surpass 30 °C (86 °F) in the summer.
Throughout the summer, the city averages almost no precipitation, and less
than 20 mm (0.79 in) during other months.[66] Rainfall is scarce, at a total
of 75 mm (2.95 in) per year, falling on isolated days mostly between October
to March. Winters are cool and the temperature rarely drops below 7 °C (45
°F).[67]

### Ethnicity and languages[edit]

The population of Doha is overwhelmingly composed of expatriates, with Qatari
nationals forming a minority. The largest portion of expatriates in Qatar are
from South-East and South Asian countries, mainly India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, Philippines, and Bangladesh with large numbers of expatriates also
coming from the Levant Arab countries, North Africa, and East Asia. Doha is
also home to a large number of expatriates from Europe, North America, South
Africa, and Australia.[83]

Arabic is the official language of Qatar. English is commonly used as a second
language,[84] and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce.[85] As there
is a large expatriate population in Doha, languages such as Malayalam,
Tagalog, Spanish, French, Urdu and Hindi are widely spoken.[83]

In 2004, the Foreign Ownership of Real Estate Law was passed, permitting non-
Qatari citizens to buy land in designated areas of Doha, including the West
Bay Lagoon, the Qatar Pearl, and the new Lusail City.[55] Prior to this,
expatriates were prohibited from owning land in Qatar. Ownership by foreigners
in Qatar entitles them to a renewable residency permit, which allows them to
live and work in Qatar.[75]

Each month, thousands immigrate to Qatar, and as a result, Doha has witnessed
explosive growth rates in population. Doha's population currently stands at
around one million,[79] with the population of the city more than doubling
from 2000 to 2010. Due to the high influx of expatriates, the Qatari housing
market saw a shortage of supply which led to a rise in prices and increased
inflation. The gap in the housing market between supply and demand has
narrowed, however, and property prices have fallen in some areas following a
period which saw rents triple in some areas.[86]

According to Qatar Chamber, expatriate workers have remitted $60bn between
2006 and 2012. 54 percent of the workers' remittances of $60bn were routed to
Asian countries, followed by Arab nations that accounted for nearly half that
volume (28 percent). India was the top destination of the remittances,
followed by the Philippines, while the US, Egypt and the neighbouring UAE
trailed.[87]

### Religion[edit]

The majority of residents in Doha are Muslim.[88] Catholics account for over
90% of the 150,000 Christian population in Doha.[89] Following decrees by the
Emir for the allocation of land to churches, the first Catholic church, Our
Lady of the Rosary, was opened in Doha in March 2008. The church structure is
discreet and Christian symbols are not displayed on the outside of the
building.[90] Several other churches exist in Doha, including the [1] St.Isaac
and St. George Greek Orthodox Church of Qatar the Syro-Malabar Church,
Malankara Orthodox Church, Mar Thoma Church (affiliated with the Anglicans,
but not part of the Communion), CSI Church, Syro-Malankara Church and a
Pentecostal church. A majority of mosques are either Muwahhid or Sunni-
oriented.[91]

## Administration[edit]

### Districts[edit]

Doha's Al Dafna area.

Main article: List of communities in Doha

At the turn of the 20th century, Doha was divided into 9 main districts.[92]
In the 2010 census, there were more than 60 districts recorded in Doha
Municipality.[93] Some of the districts of Doha include:

  * Al Bidda (البدع)
  * Al Dafna (الدفنة)
  * Al Ghanim (الغانم)
  * Al Markhiya (المرخية)
  * Al Sadd (السد)
  * Al Waab (الوعب)
  * Bin Mahmoud (فريج بن محمود)
  * Madinat Khalifa (مدينة خليفة)
  * Musheireb (مشيرب)
  * Najma (نجمه)
  * Old Airport (المطار القديم)
  * Qutaifiya (القطيفية)
  * Ras Abu Aboud (راس أبو عبود)
  * Rumeilah (الرميلة)
  * Umm Ghuwailina (ام غو يلينه)
  * West Bay (الخليج الغربي)

Shortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha
including Al Najada, Al Asmakh and Old Al Hitmi faced gradual decline and as a
result much of their historical architecture has been demolished.[94] Instead,
the government shifted their focus toward the Doha Bay area, which housed
districts such as Al Dafna and West Bay.[94]

## Economy[edit]

See also: Economy of Qatar

Commercial district in Doha.

Doha is the economic centre of Qatar. The city is the headquarters of numerous
domestic and international organizations, including the country's largest oil
and gas companies, Qatar Petroleum, Qatargas and RasGas. Doha's economy is
built primarily on the revenue the country has made from its oil and natural
gas industries.[95]

Beginning in the late 20th century, the government launched numerous
initiatives to diversify the country's economy in order to decrease its
dependence on oil and gas resources. Doha International Airport was
constructed in a bid to solidify the city's diversification into the tourism
industry.[95] This was replaced by Hamad International Airport in 2014. The
new airport is almost twice the size of the former and features two of the
longest runways in the world.[96]

As a result of Doha's rapid population boom and increased housing demands,
real estate prices have raised significantly.[97] Real estate prices
experienced a further spike after Qatar won the rights to host the 2022 FIFA
World Cup.[98] Al Asmakh, a Qatari real estate firm, released a report in 2014
which revealed substantial increases in real estate prices following a peak in
2008. Prices increased 5 to 10% in the first quarter of 2014 from the end of
2013.[97][99] A 2015 study conducted by Numbeo, a crowd-sourced database,
named Doha as the 10th most expensive city to live in globally.[100] This rate
of growth has led to the development of planned communities in and around the
city.[101]

Thirty-nine new hotels were under construction in 2011.[102] Doha was included
in Fortune's 15 best new cities for business in 2011.[103]

## Infrastructure[edit]

### Architecture[edit]

Museum of Islamic Arts Park in West Bay, Doha.

Most traditional architecture in the Old Doha districts have been demolished
to make space for new buildings.[94] As a result, a number of schemes have
been taken to preserve the city's cultural and architectural heritage, such as
the Qatar Museums Authority's 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage')
initiative.[104] Katara Cultural Village is a small village in Doha launched
by sheikh Tamim Al Thani to preserve the cultural identity of the
country.[105]

Skyline of Doha near the Doha Corniche.

In 2011, more than 50 towers were under construction in Doha,[102] the largest
of which was the Doha Convention Center Tower.[106] Constructions were
suspended in 2012 following concerns that the tower would impede flight
traffic.[107]

In 2014, Abdullah Al Attiyah, a senior government official, announced that
Qatar would be spending $65bn on new infrastructure projects in upcoming years
in preparation for the 2022 World Cup as well as progressing towards its
objectives set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030.[108]

### Atmosphere[edit]

Due to excessive heat from the sun during the summer, some Doha-based building
companies have implemented various forms of cooling technology to alleviate
the extremely torrid climatic conditions. This can include creating optical
phenomena such as shadows, as well as more expensive techniques like
ventilation, coolants, refrigerants, cryogenics, and dehumidifiers.[109]
Discussions regarding temperature control have also been features of various
scheduled events involving large crowds.[110] There are other initiatives that
attempt to counter the heat by altering working hours, weather alteration
methods such as cloud seeding.,[111][112] and using whiter and brighter
construction materials to increase the albedo effects.[113] Nonetheless,
despite these measures, Doha and other areas of Qatar could become
uninhabitable for humans due to climate change by the 2070s.[114]

### Planned communities[edit]

Al Waab City.

One of the largest projects underway in Qatar is Lusail City, a planned
community north of Doha which is estimated to be completed by 2020 at a cost
of approximately $45bn. It is designed to accommodate 450,000 people.[115] Al
Waab City, another planned community under development, is estimated to cost
QR15 bn.[116] In addition to housing 8,000 individuals, it will also have
shopping malls, educational, and medical facilities.[116]

## Transportation[edit]

Main article: Transportation in Doha

Qatar, Dukhan Highway

Since 2004, Doha has been undergoing a huge expansion to its transportation
network, including the addition of new highways, the opening of a new airport
in 2014, and the currently ongoing construction of an 85 km metro system. This
has all been as a result of Doha's massive growth in a short period of time,
which has resulted in congestion on its roads. The first phase of the metro
system is expected to be operational by 2019.[117]

In 2015, the Public Works Authority declared their plan to construct a free-
flowing road directly linking Al-Wakrah and Mesaieed to Doha in order to
decrease traffic congestion in the city. It is set for completion by
2018.[118]

## Education[edit]
