The United States Census Bureau (USCB; officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title 13 U.S.C. ยง 11) is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and economy.
The Census Bureau's primary mission is conducting the U.S. Census every ten years, which allocates the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to the states based on their population. In addition to the decennial census, the Census Bureau continually conducts dozens of other censuses and surveys, including the American Community Survey, the U.S. Economic Census, and the Current Population Survey. Furthermore, economic and foreign trade indicators released by the federal government typically contain data produced by the Census Bureau. The Bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $400 billion in federal funds every year and help states, local communities, and businesses make informed decisions.  
The Census Bureau is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and its director is appointed by the President of the United States.
