Dameronia was the name of a bebop jazz ensemble founded by Don Sickler and Philly Joe Jones in the 1980s that featured the original compositions and arrangements of Tadd Dameron. They recorded three albums, two for Uptown Records and the other for Soul Note Records, and continued to perform even after Jones' death in 1985. The nonet, which included several of the composer's colleagues, attempted to create an "historically accurate" representation of Dameron's music.
