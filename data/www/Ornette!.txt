Ornette! is the seventh album by alto saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman, released on Atlantic Records in 1962, his fifth for the label. The album features Scott LaFaro in place of Charlie Haden, who had left the Quartet but would work again with Coleman in the future.
The recording session took place on January 31, 1961, at Atlantic Studios in New York City. Three outtakes from the session, "Proof Readers," "Check Up," and "The Alchemy of Scott LaFaro" would later appear respectively on the 1993 box set Beauty Is A Rare Thing, and on 1970s compilations Twins and The Art of the Improvisers.
The titles of the compositions are initialisms derived from works by Sigmund Freud: Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious, Totem and Taboo, Civilization and its Discontents, and the essay Relation of the Poet to Day Dreaming.
