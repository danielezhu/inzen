The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School (also referred to as Haberdashers', Habs or Habs Boys) is a private school for boys aged 5–18 in Elstree, Hertfordshire, England. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Haileybury Group.
In 1997, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail named Haberdashers' the best school in the country, and in 2001 and 2017 it was The Sunday Times independent school of the Year. In 2012 and 2016, it was also the top independent boys' school in the country. Approximately 20% of students go on to study at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, putting the school at 19th in the country in terms of Oxbridge admissions. The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School frequently tops the league tables and rarely falls out of the top 10. In 2014, The Telegraph placed the school at 8th in the country for A-Levels – with 80.87% of grades achieving the A*–A grades. In 2015, the Sunday Times named HABS Prep the best school in England due to its results and resources.
The school was founded in 1690 by a Royal Charter granted to the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers to establish a hospital for twenty boarders with £32,000 from the legacy of Robert Aske (£4,300,000 in today's money). The school relocated from the premises of the old hospital in 1903 and presently occupies 104 acres of greenbelt parkland in Elstree. At its centre is Aldenham House, a Grade II* listed building; it was formerly the seat of the Lords Aldenham and home to Vicary Gibbs MP. Until the early 1980s, the school offered boarding to a proportion of the school's students; however, it has since converted to an all-day school, with the boarding quarters now converted into offices.
