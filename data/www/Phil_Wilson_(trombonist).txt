Phillips Elder Wilson, Jr. (born January 19, 1937 in Belmont, Massachusetts) is a jazz trombonist, arranger, and teacher. He has taught at the Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music.
He began on piano but was advised to switch to trombone due to his having a mild form of dyslexia. This condition did not hamper his music, and by fifteen he had turned professional. He played for Herb Pomeroy's band from 1955 to 1957 and then toured with the Dorsey Brothers. He worked with Woody Herman and in the 1960s wrote music for Buddy Rich. He joined the faculty at Berklee in 1965. He formed an ensemble there that became one of the most well-regarded college jazz bands.
In April 2004, Phil Wilson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music during the 40th anniversary celebration of his Rainbow Band.
