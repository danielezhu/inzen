"Into the West" is a song performed by Annie Lennox, and the end-credit song of the 2003 film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. It is written and composed by Lennox, Return of the King producer and co-writer, Fran Walsh, and the film's composer Howard Shore. The song plays in full during the closing credits of the 2003 film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, although instrumental music from the song plays at other points during the film itself. The song was later covered by New Zealand singers Yulia Townsend and Will Martin and American singer Peter Hollens. In 2014, German a cappella Metal band van Canto performed a cover on their fifth studio album, Dawn of the Brave.
