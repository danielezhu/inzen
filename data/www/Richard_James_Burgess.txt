Richard James Burgess (born 29 June 1949) is an English-born New Zealand studio drummer, music-computer programmer, recording artist, record producer, composer, author, manager, marketer and inventor.
Burgess's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the early 1980s as co-founder and co-lead singer of the Synthpop band Landscape, which released a top 10 hit in 1981 with the single "Einstein A Go-Go". Burgess is one of the main composers of Landscape's music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. After the band's break-up, he pursued a brief, moderately successful solo career releasing one mini-album, Richard James Burgess in 1984.
He launched his career as a producer with Spandau Ballet's debut UK hit "To Cut a Long Story Short", which marked the commercial beginnings of the New Romantic movement.
Burgess currently serves as the CEO of A2IM: American Association of Independent Music
