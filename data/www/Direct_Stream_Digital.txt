DSD Records (DSD) is the name of a trademark used by Sony and Philips for their system of digitally recreating audible signals for the Super Audio CD (SACD).
DSD uses pulse-density modulation encodingâ€”a technology to store audio signals on digital storage media that are used for the SACD. The signal is stored as delta-sigma modulated digital audio; a sequence of single-bit values at a sampling rate of 2.8224 MHz (64 times the CD audio sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, but only at 1/32768 of its 16-bit resolution). Noise shaping occurs by use of the 64-timed oversampled signal to reduce noise and distortion caused by the inaccuracy of quantization of the audio signal to a single bit. Therefore, it is a topic of discussion whether it is possible to eliminate distortion in one-bit delta-sigma conversion.
