Fischerspooner is an electroclash duo and performance troupe formed in 1998 in New York City. The name is a combination of the founders' last names, Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner. Influenced by retro electropop tendencies (arguably similar to Kraftwerk, early Pet Shop Boys, and Gary Numan) Fischerspooner uses a modern approach to programming.
