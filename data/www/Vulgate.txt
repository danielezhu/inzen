The Vulgate () is a late fourth-century Latin translation of the Bible that became, during the 16th century, the Catholic Church's officially promulgated Latin version of the Bible.
The translation was largely the work of St. Jerome, who, in 382 AD, had been commissioned by Pope Damasus I to revise the Vetus Latina ("Old Latin") Gospels then in use by the Roman Church. Jerome, on his own initiative, extended this work of revision and translation to include most of the Books of the Bible; and once published the new version was widely adopted, and eventually eclipsed the Vetus Latina; so that by the 13th century, it took over from the former version the appellation of "versio vulgata"  (the "version commonly-used") or, more simply, in Latin as vulgata or in Greek as βουλγάτα ("Voulgata").
The Catholic Church affirmed the Vulgate as its official Latin Bible at the Council of Trent (1545–63 AD), though there was no authoritative edition at that time. Then the Clementine edition of the Vulgate of 1592 became the standard Bible text of the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church; and remained so until 1979 when the Nova Vulgata was promulgated.
