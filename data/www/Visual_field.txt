The visual field is the "spatial array of visual sensations available to observation in introspectionist psychological experiments".
The equivalent concept for optical instruments and sensors is the field of view (FOV).
In optometry, ophthalmology, and neurology, a visual field test is used to determine whether the visual field is affected by diseases that cause local scotoma or a more extensive loss of vision or a reduction in sensitivity (increase in threshold).
