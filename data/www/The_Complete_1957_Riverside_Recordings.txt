The Complete 1957 Riverside Recordings is a 2006 release of Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane's work for the Riverside Records label in 1957, with two tracks previously unreleased in any form.
This collection is an almost complete anthology of the work of Monk and Coltrane, who only recorded together in the studio during 1957. The set draws from the self-titled Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane, Monk's Music and a solitary trio track from Thelonious Himself. Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall and Discovery! are the only other recordings documenting this musical association.
