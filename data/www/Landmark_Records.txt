Landmark Records was an American jazz record company and label founded in 1985 by Orrin Keepnews. Landmark's releases included music by Donald Byrd, Jack DeJohnette, Jimmy Heath, Vincent Herring, Bobby Hutcherson, Mulgrew Miller, Buddy Montgomery, and reissues of Cannonball Adderley.
Its catalogue also included two jazz albums by the Kronos Quartet in which they covered the work of Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk. Landmark was bought by Muse Records in 1993. Muse and Landmark were acquired by 32 Jazz in 1996. In 2003, Savoy Jazz (which had become a subsidiary of Nippon Columbia) acquired the rights to the Muse and Landmark catalogs from 32 Jazz.
