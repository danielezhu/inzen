**World War  II** (often abbreviated to **WWII** or **WW2** ), also known as
the **Second World War** , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945,
although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the
world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two
opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most
widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people
from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw
their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war
effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 million
to 85 million fatalities, most of which were civilians in the Soviet Union and
China. It included massacres, the deliberate genocide of the Holocaust,
strategic bombing, starvation, disease and the first use of nuclear weapons in
history.[1][2][3][4]

The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at
war with the Republic of China in 1937,[5] but the world war is generally said
to have begun on 1 September 1939[6] with the invasion of Poland by Nazi
Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United
Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties,
Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the
Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of
August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories
of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states.
The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition
of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with campaigns including
the North Africa and East Africa campaigns, the aerial Battle of Britain, the
Blitz bombing campaign, and the Balkan Campaign, as well as the long-running
Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an
invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in
history, which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a war
of attrition. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European
colonies in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western
Pacific.

The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway,
and Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at
Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on
the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of
Italy which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the
Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all
fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the
Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and
its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in
mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the
Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies
and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops,
the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the subsequent German unconditional surrender
on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945
and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States
dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6
August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago
imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the Soviet
invasion of Manchuria, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. Thus
ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.

World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the
world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-
operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—China,
France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[7] The Soviet Union
and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the
Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of
European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Africa and Asia
began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic
recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to
end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.[8]

The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September
1939,[9][10] beginning with the German invasion of Poland; Britain and France
declared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war in
the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July
1937,[11][12] or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September
1931.[13][14]

Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-
Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and
the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other
starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of
Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[15] The British historian Antony Beevor views the
beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan
and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September
1939.[16]

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was
generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14
August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September
1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951.[17] A treaty regarding
Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take
place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.[18]

## Background

Main article: Causes of World War II

### Europe

World War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat
of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the
Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which
eventually led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious
Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece,
gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of
Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.

The League of Nations assembly, held in Geneva, Switzerland, 1930

To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during the
1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent
armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament,
and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and
arbitration.

Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I,[19] its aftermath still
caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states.
These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant
territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of
Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home
territory and all of its overseas possessions, while German annexation of
other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed
on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.[20]

The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and a
democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was created. The
interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline
opponents on both the right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some
post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that
the promises made by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the
war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist
movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist,
totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative
democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an
aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power,
promising the creation of a "New Roman Empire".[21]

Adolf Hitler at a German National Socialist political rally in Weimar, October
1930

Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government
in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished
democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world
order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.[22] Meanwhile, France, to
secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy
desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935
when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and
Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament
programme, and introduced conscription.[23]

To contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa
Front in April 1935; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an
independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The
Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern
Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking
effect though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the
bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially
toothless.[24] The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia,
passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.[25]

Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno treaties by remilitarising the
Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition.[26] In October 1936,
Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis. A month later, Germany and
Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would join in the following
year.

### Asia

The Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against
regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon
embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies[27]
and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of
Japan, which had long sought influence in China[28] as the first step of what
its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden
Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the
puppet state of Manchukuo.[29]

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the League of Nations for help.
Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its
incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in
Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933.
Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese
aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.[30] After the 1936 Xi'an
Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present
a united front to oppose Japan.[31]

## Pre-war events

### Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)

Main article: Second Italo-Ethiopian War

Italian soldiers recruited in 1935, on their way to fight the Second Italo-
Abyssinian War

The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October
1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian
Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy (
_Regno d'Italia_ ), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and
Eritrea.[32] The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its
annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa ( _Africa
Orientale Italiana_ , or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the
League of Nations as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were
member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated
the League's Article X.[33] Germany was the only major European nation to
support the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's
goal of absorbing Austria.[34]

### Spanish Civil War (1936–39)

Main article: Spanish Civil War

The bombing of Guernica in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, sparked Europe-
wide fears that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very
high civilian casualties

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support
to the Nationalist rebels, led by General Francisco Franco. The Soviet Union
supported the existing government, the Spanish Republic. Over 30,000 foreign
volunteers, known as the International Brigades, also fought against the
Nationalists. Both Germany and the USSR used this proxy war as an opportunity
to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists
won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially
neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.[35] His greatest
collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the
Eastern Front.[36]

### Japanese invasion of China (1937)

Main article: Second Sino-Japanese War

Japanese Imperial Army soldiers during the Battle of Shanghai, 1937

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking
after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which culminated in the
Japanese campaign to invade all of China.[37] The Soviets quickly signed a
non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending
China's prior co-operation with Germany. From September to November, the
Japanese attacked Taiyuan,[38][39] as well as engaging the Kuomintang Army
around Xinkou[38][39] and Communist forces in Pingxingguan.[40][41]
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but,
after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push
the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After
the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese
civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.[42][43]

In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at
Taierzhuang but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May.[44] In
June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow
River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at
Wuhan, but the city was taken by October.[45] Japanese military victories did
not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to
achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and
continued the war.[46][47]

### Soviet–Japanese border conflicts

Main article: Soviet–Japanese border conflicts

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border
clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The
Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion
northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the
Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese
War[48] and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this
policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union
eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the
doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward,
eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western
Allies.[49][50]

### European occupations and agreements

Further information: Anschluss, Appeasement, Munich Agreement, German
occupation of Czechoslovakia, and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact

Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano pictured just before
signing the Munich Agreement, 29 September 1938

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938,
Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European
powers.[51] Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the
Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German
population; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the
Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak
government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[52]
Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional
territory to Hungary and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie region.[53]

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement,
privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from
seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler
attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 secretly ordered
a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In
March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently
split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German
client state, the Slovak Republic.[54] Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to
Lithuania, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region.

Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of
Danzig, Britain and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence;
when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to
Romania and Greece.[55] Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland,
Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel.[56]
Hitler accused Britain and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and
renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-
Aggression Pact.

Joseph Stalin, after signing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 23 August 1939

In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop
Pact,[57] a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol. The parties gave
each other rights to "spheres of influence" (western Poland and Lithuania for
Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the
USSR). It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence.[58] The
agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have
to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it
defeated Poland.

The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops
continued to mobilise against the Polish border. In a private meeting with the
Italian foreign minister, Count Ciano, Hitler asserted that Poland was a
"doubtful neutral" that needed to either yield to his demands or be
"liquidated" to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future
"unavoidable" war with the Western democracies. He did not believe Britain or
France would intervene in the conflict.[59] On 23 August Hitler ordered the
attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a
formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain
neutrality, he decided to delay it.[60]

In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany
made demands on Poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen
relations.[61] On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary
immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow
a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on
secession.[61] The Poles refused to comply with the German demands and on the
night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville
Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims
rejected.[62]

Poland and the Free City of Danzig after the invasion, September 1939

On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland under the false pretext that the
Poles had carried out a series of sabotage operations against German targets
near the border.[63] Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum
to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France,
followed by the fully independent Dominions[64] of the British
Commonwealth[65]—Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September), New Zealand
(3 September), and South Africa (6 September)—declared war on Germany.
However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to
Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the
Saarland.[66] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which
aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[67] Germany responded by
ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to
later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.

September, 1939

On 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviets
invaded Poland from the east.[68] The Polish army was defeated and Warsaw
surrendered to the Germans on 27 September with final pockets of resistance
surrendering on 6 October. Poland's territory was divided between Germany and
the Soviet Union, with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares.
After the defeat of Poland's armed forces, the Polish resistance established
an Underground State and a partisan Home Army.[69] About 100,000 Polish
military personnel were evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries; many of
these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theatres of the
war.[70] Poland's Enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to France.[71]

On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to Britain and France, but
said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and
the Soviet Union. Chamberlain rejected this on 12 October, saying "Past
experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the
present German Government."[62] After this rejection Hitler ordered an
immediate offensive against France,[72] but bad weather forced repeated
postponements until the spring of 1940.[73][74][75]

Lithuania—to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries under pacts
of "mutual assistance".[76][77][78] Finland rejected territorial demands,
prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939.[79] The resulting Winter War
ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.[80] Britain and France, treating
the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side
of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's
expulsion from the League of Nations.[78]

In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania,[77] and the disputed Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern
Bukovina and Hertza. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political rapprochement and
economic co-operation[81][82] gradually stalled,[83][ _page  needed_][84] and
both states began preparations for war.[85]

### Western Europe (1940–41)

Main article: Western Front (World War II)

Map of the French Maginot Line

In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron
ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut off by unilaterally
mining neutral Norwegian waters.[86] Denmark capitulated after a few hours,
and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik
temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two
months.[87] British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the
replacement of the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston
Churchill on 10 May 1940.[88]

Germany launched an offensive against France and, adhering to the Manstein
Plan also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Luxembourg on 10 May 1940.[89] That same day British forces landed in Iceland
and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands.[90] The
U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed
to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal
establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun
using blitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks, respectively.[91] The
French-fortified Maginot Line and the main body of the Allied forces which had
moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the
thickly wooded Ardennes region,[92] mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as
an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.[93][94] As a
result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an
encirclement and were beaten. The majority were taken prisoner, whilst over
300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at
Dunkirk by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.[95]

On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United
Kingdom.[96] Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June and eight days later France
signed an armistice with Germany and was soon divided into German and Italian
occupation zones,[97] and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime,
which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France
kept its fleet but the British feared the Germans would seize it, so on 3
July, the British attacked it.[98]

The Battle of Britain[99] began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on
shipping and harbours.[100] On 19 July, Hitler again publicly offered to end
the war, saying he had no desire to destroy the British Empire. The United
Kingdom rejected this ultimatum.[101] The main German air superiority campaign
started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, and a proposed
invasion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September. The German strategic
bombing offensive intensified as night attacks on London and other cities in
the Blitz, but largely failed to disrupt the British war effort.[100]

Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an
over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the
Atlantic.[102] The British scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by
sinking the German battleship _Bismarck_.[103] Perhaps most importantly,
during the Battle of Britain the Royal Air Force had successfully resisted the
Luftwaffe's assault, and the German bombing campaign largely ended in May
1941.[104]

Throughout this period, the neutral United States took measures to assist
China and the Western Allies. In November 1939, the American Neutrality Act
was amended to allow "cash and carry" purchases by the Allies.[105] In 1940,
following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was
significantly increased. In September, the United States further agreed to a
trade of American destroyers for British bases.[106] Still, a large majority
of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention
into the conflict well into 1941.[107]

Although Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war, he
nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war. In December 1940 he
accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as
useless, calling for the US to become an "arsenal of democracy" and promoted
the passage of Lend-Lease aid to support the British war effort.[101] In
January 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for the
purposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war.
They decided on a number of offensive policies, including an air offensive,
the "early elimination" of Italy, raids, support of resistance groups, and the
capture of positions to launch an offensive against Germany.[108]

At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and
Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any
country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked
any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.[109] The Axis
expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the
Tripartite Pact.[110] Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary)
to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to
the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat
communism.[111]

### Mediterranean (1940–41)

Main article: Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II

Italy began operations in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in
June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into
British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the
Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but
within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon
occurred.[112] The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance
by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided
that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist
the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans,
to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to
secure his hold on Romanian oil.[113]

In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against
Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.[114] The offensive in North
Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control
of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner.
The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy
putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at
Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape
Matapan.[115]

The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy. Hitler sent German forces to
Libya in February, and by the end of March the Axis had launched an offensive
which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support
Greece.[116] In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt
with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk that fell later.[117] The
Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but
failed on both occasions.[118]

By late March 1941, following Bulgaria's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the
Germans were in position to intervene in Greece. Plans were changed, however,
because of developments in neighbouring Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government
had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown two days
later by a British-encouraged coup. Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile
and immediately decided to eliminate it. On 6 April Germany simultaneously
invaded both Yugoslavia and Greece, making rapid progress and forcing both
nations to surrender within the month. The British were driven from the
Balkans after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of
May.[119] Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare
subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which
continued until the end of the war.

The Allies did have some successes during this time. In the Middle East,
Commonwealth forces first quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported
by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria,[120] then, with
the assistance of the Free French, invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent
further such occurrences.[121]

mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war

Axis Powers

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and
the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions
with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War
by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two
powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.[122] By
contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the
Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.[123]

Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope
that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against
Germany sooner or later.[124] He therefore decided to try to strengthen
Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate
them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if
the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some
interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan
that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the
directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.

1941

On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet
Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting
against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.[125] The
primary targets of this surprise offensive[126][ _page  needed_] were the
Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941
campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White
Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military
power, exterminate Communism, generate _Lebensraum_ ("living space")[127] by
dispossessing the native population[128] [ _page  needed_] and guarantee
access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining
rivals.[129][ _page  needed_]

Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before
the war,[130][ _page  needed_] _Barbarossa_ forced the Soviet supreme command
to adopt a strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant
gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and
materiel. By the middle of August, however, the German Army High Command
decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre,
and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards
central Ukraine and Leningrad.[131] [ _page  needed_] The Kiev offensive was
overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four
Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially
developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).[132]

The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their
air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front[133]
prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.[134][ _page  needed_] In
July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against
Germany[135] The British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the
Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields.[136] In August, the United Kingdom and
the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter.[137]

By October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were
achieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad[138][ _page  needed_] and
Sevastopol continuing.[139] A major offensive against Moscow was renewed;
after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German
army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted
troops[140] were forced to suspend their offensive.[141] Large territorial
gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its
main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet
capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a
considerable part of its military potential. The _blitzkrieg_ phase of the war
in Europe had ended.[142] [ _page  needed_]

By early December, freshly mobilised reserves[143][ _page  needed_] allowed
the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.[144] This, as well
as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops
in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung
Army,[145][ _page  needed_] allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-
offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German
troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.[146]

### War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)

Main article: Pacific War

In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan; and,
beginning with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to
increasing economic pressure.[101] During this time, Japan launched its first
attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was
repulsed by late September.[147] Despite several offensives by both sides, the
war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on
China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the
event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern
Indochina.[148] Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and
mechanical parts against Japan.[149] Other sanctions soon followed.

Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early
1940. In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in
retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human
and material resources for the communists.[150] Continued antipathy between
Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in
January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.[151] In March, the
Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was
repulsed during Battle of Shanggao.[152] In September, Japan attempted to take
the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.[153]

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European
governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan
some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional
access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.[154] In July 1941
Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch
possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other
Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and
a total oil embargo.[155][156] At the same time, Japan was planning an
invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to capitalize off the German
invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.[157]

Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations
in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China.
During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were
dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.[158] At the same time the US,
Britain, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint
defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of
them.[159] Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate
scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the US would react
to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".[159]

fleet, 7 December 1941

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-
British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new
government under Hideki Tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer.
It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and
other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks
in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.[158] The
American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of
China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific
powers.[160] That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between
abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed
in the Dutch East Indies by force;[161] the Japanese military did not consider
the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken
declaration of war.[162]

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large
defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would
then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the
over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.[163] To prevent American
intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise
the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the
Philippines from the outset.[164] On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time
zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous
offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.[165] These included
an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in
Thailand and Malaya[165] and the battle of Hong Kong.

These attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia and several
other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being
heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries,
maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.[166] Germany, followed by the
other Axis states, declared war on the United States[167] in solidarity with
Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that
had been ordered by Roosevelt.[125][168]

### Axis advance stalls (1942–43)

Seated at the Casablanca Conference; US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and
British PM Winston Churchill, January 1943

On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four[169]—the Soviet Union, China, Britain
and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the
Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter,[170]
and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to
pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The
Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through
France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the
other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to
wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster
resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing
campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by
Allied armour without using large-scale armies.[171] Eventually, the British
persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and
they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.[172]

At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the
statements issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded
the unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed
to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to
fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.[173] Although the British argued
for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May
1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations
in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade
France in 1944.[174]

#### Pacific (1942–43)

Map of Japanese military advances, until mid-1942

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully
conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul,
inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of
prisoners.[175] Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the
Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its
government into exile.[176] On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were
encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and
rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.[177] Japanese forces also achieved naval
victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean,[178] and bombed
the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied
success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.[179] These easy
victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident,
as well as overextended.[180]

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by
amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the
United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied
task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval
forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea.[181] Japan's next plan,
motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure
American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would
also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.[182] In mid-May,
Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in China, with the goal of
inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen
in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese
23rd and 32nd Army Groups.[183][184] In early June, Japan put its operations
into action but the Americans, having broken Japanese naval codes in late May,
were fully aware of plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to
achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.[185]

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the
Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port
Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.[186] The Americans
planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon
Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the
main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.[187]

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal
took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to
withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where
they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-
Gona.[188] Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy
commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of
1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.[189]
In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive
into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back
to India by May 1943.[190] The second was the insertion of irregular forces
behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had
achieved mixed results.[191]

#### Eastern Front (1942–43)

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a
major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most
territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.[192] In May the
Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov,[193]
and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June
1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while
maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The
Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the
lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B
headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at
Stalingrad on the Volga.[194]

By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street
fighting when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive,
starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad[195] and an
assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed
disastrously.[196] By early February 1943, the German Army had taken
tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to
surrender,[197] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position
before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had
tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a
salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.[198]

#### Western Europe/Atlantic & Mediterranean (1942–43)

Wulf factory in Germany, 9 October 1943

Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged
Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.[199] By November 1941,
Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in
North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had
made.[200] In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January,
pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early
February,[201] followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to
prepare for their upcoming offensives.[202] Concerns the Japanese might use
bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in
early May 1942.[203] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep
inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.[204] On the
Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the
disastrous Dieppe Raid,[205] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to
launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation,
equipment, and operational security.[206][ _page  needed_]

In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El
Alamein[207] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed
supplies to the besieged Malta.[208] A few months later, the Allies commenced
an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a
drive west across Libya.[209] This attack was followed up shortly after by
Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region
joining the Allies.[210] Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by
ordering the occupation of Vichy France;[210] although Vichy forces did not
resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to
prevent its capture by German forces.[210][211] The now pincered Axis forces
in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May
1943.[210][212]

In early 1943 the British and Americans began the Combined Bomber Offensive, a
strategic bombing campaign against Germany. The goals were to disrupt the
German war economy, reduce German morale, and "de-house" the civilian
population.[213]

### Allies gain momentum (1943–44)

_Lexington_ during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, 1943

After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations
against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent
to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.[214] Soon after, the U.S.,
with support from Australian and New Zealand forces, began major operations to
isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese
Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.[215] By the end
of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives, and had also
neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. In April,
the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea.[216] In the
Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early
summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July
1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week,
German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned
and well-constructed defences[217] and, for the first time in the war, Hitler
cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational
success.[218] This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies'
invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian
failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that
month.[219] Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over
40,000 people.[220]

Kursk, 1943

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby
dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The
Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,[221] giving the
Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.[222][223] The Germans tried
to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan
line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper
Offensives.[224]

On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland,
following Italy's armistice with the Allies.[225] Germany with the help of
fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places
without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,[226] and
creating a series of defensive lines.[227] German special forces then rescued
Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied
Italy named the Italian Social Republic,[228] causing an Italian civil war.
The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German
defensive line in mid-November.[229]

shek, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill meeting at the Cairo
Conference, 25 November 1943

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied
counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German
submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval
campaign.[230] In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill
met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran.[231]
The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese
territory[232] and the military planning for the Burma Campaign,[233] while
the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in
1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months
of Germany's defeat.[234]

From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese
forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied
relief.[235][236][237] In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of
attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it
with landings at Anzio.[238] By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive
expelled German forces from the Leningrad region,[239] ending the longest and
most lethal siege in history.

The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by
the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national
independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea
region.[240] By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely
expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which
were repulsed by the Axis troops.[241] The Allied offensives in Italy had
succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat,
on 4 June, Rome was captured.[242]

The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese
launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in
Assam, India,[243] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and
Kohima.[244] In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that
drove Japanese troops back to Burma,[244] and Chinese forces that had invaded
northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.[245] The
second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting
forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied
airfields.[246] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and
begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.[247]

### Allies close in (1944)

D-Day, 6 June 1944

On 6 June 1944 (known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure,[248]
the Western Allies invaded northern France. After reassigning several Allied
divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France.[249] These landings
were successful, and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France.
Paris was liberated by the local resistance assisted by the Free French
Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, on 25 August[250] and the
Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during
the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany
spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.[251]
After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross
the Ruhr river in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due
to the last major German defensive line.[252]

Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation, August 1944

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("Operation
Bagration") that destroyed the German Army Group Centre almost
completely.[253] Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced
German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance
prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings against the
German occupation. However, the largest of these in Warsaw, where German
soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians, and a national uprising in Slovakia, did
not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the
Germans.[254] The Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off
and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful
coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to
the Allied side.[255]

In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid
withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to
rescue them from being cut off.[256] By this point, the Communist-led
Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly
successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled
much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against
German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited
support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of
the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets
launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until
the fall of Budapest in February 1945.[257] Unlike impressive Soviet victories
in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the
Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-
Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions,[258][259] although Finland
was forced to fight their former allies.

October 1944

By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled
the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin
River[260] while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese
force captured the Mount Song to reopen the Burma Road.[261] In China, the
Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and
the city of Hengyang by early August.[262] Soon after, they invaded the
province of Guangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at
Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November[263] and successfully linking up
their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.[264]

In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In
mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau
islands, and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the
Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime
Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch
intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October,
American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval
forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the
largest naval battles in history.[265]

### Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944–45)

Yalta Conference held in February 1945, with Winston Churchill, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using
most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the
Ardennes and along the French–German border to split the Western Allies,
encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary
supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement.[266] By January, the
offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.[266] In
Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In
mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the
Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.[267] On 4
February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They
agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union
would join the war against Japan.[268]

In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies
entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western
Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German
Army Group B,[269] while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the
Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western
Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces
stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river
on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the
military defeat of Nazi Germany.[270]

Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April,
President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Benito
Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.[271] Two days later,
Hitler committed suicide, and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz.[272]

The German Reichstag after its capture by the Allied forces, 3 June 1945

German forces surrendered in Italy on 29 April. Total and unconditional
surrender was signed on 7 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.[273]
German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.[274]

In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the
Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines, clearing Leyte by the end
of April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in
March following a battle which reduced the city to ruins. Fighting continued
on Luzon, Mindanao, and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the
war.[275] Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) were destroying
strategic and populated cities and towns in Japan in an effort to destroy
Japanese war industry and civilian morale. On the night of 9–10 March, USAAF
B-29 bombers struck Tokyo with thousands of incendiary bombs, which killed
100,000 civilians and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2) within a few hours.
Over the next five months, the USAAF firebombed a total of 67 Japanese cities,
killing 393,000 civilians and destroying 65% of built-up areas.[276]

In May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, overrunning the oilfields
there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern
Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May.[277]
Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred
between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also
moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of
June.[278] At the same time, American submarines cut off Japanese imports,
drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces.[279]

Japanese foreign affairs minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signs the Japanese
Instrument of Surrender on board USS  _Missouri_, 2 September 1945

On 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed earlier
agreements about Germany,[280] and reiterated the demand for unconditional
surrender of all Japanese forces by Japan, specifically stating that "the
alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction".[281] During this
conference, the United Kingdom held its general election, and Clement Attlee
replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.[282]

The Allies called for unconditional Japanese surrender in the Potsdam
Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In
early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings as a military
necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the
lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of
Japanese troops and civilians.[283] Between the two bombings, the Soviets,
pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly
defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting
force.[284][285] The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril
Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents
finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS
_Missouri_ on 2 September 1945, ending the war.[286]

##  Aftermath

of Nazi Germany for crimes against humanity

The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The
former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter
was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the
Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification programme in
Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the removal of ex-
Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-
integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.[287]

Ruins of Warsaw in January 1945, after the deliberate destruction of the city
by the occupying German forces

Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern
territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland,
East Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR, followed by the
expulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces, as well as the
expulsion of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to
Germany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east.
The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line,
from which 2 million Poles were expelled;[288] north-east Romania,[289][290]
parts of eastern Finland,[291] and the three Baltic states were also
incorporated into the USSR.[292][293]

In an effort to maintain world peace,[294] the Allies formed the United
Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,[295] and
adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, as a common
standard for all member nations.[296] The great powers that were the victors
of the war—France, China, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United
States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council.[7] The five
permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat
changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in
1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian
Federation, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The
alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to
deteriorate even before the war was over.[297]

Post-war Soviet territorial expansion resulted in Central and Eastern European
border changes, the creation of a Communist Bloc and start of the Cold War

Germany had been _de facto_ divided, and two independent states, the Federal
Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic[298] were created
within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The
rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of
influence.[299] Most eastern and central European countries fell into the
Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full
or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East
Germany,[300] Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania[301]
became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully
independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.[302]

Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military
alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact;[303] the
long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the
Cold War, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy
wars.[304]

In Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated
Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed
Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.[305] Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was
divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the US in the South
between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th
parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of
Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.[306]

Independence Hall, 14 May 1948

In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946.
Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of
China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in
1949.[307] In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations
Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation
of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some
or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources
during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to
decolonisation.[308][309]

The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating
nations were affected differently. The US emerged much richer than any other
nation; it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person
was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the
world economy.[310] The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament
in Western Germany in the years 1945–1948.[311] Because of international trade
interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed
European recovery for several years.[312][313]

Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was
sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall
Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.[314][315] The post-1948
West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle.[316] Italy
also experienced an economic boom[317] and the French economy rebounded.[318]
By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,[319] and
although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more
than any other European country,[320] continued relative economic decline for
decades.[321]

The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced
rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era.[322] Japan
experienced incredibly rapid economic growth, becoming one of the most
powerful economies in the world by the 1980s.[323] China returned to its pre-
war industrial production by 1952.[324]

## Impact

### Casualties and war crimes

crimes in occupied Poland during World War II, German war crimes, War crimes
of the Wehrmacht, Italian war crimes, Japanese war crimes, Allied war crimes
during World War II, and Soviet war crimes

World War II deaths

Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many
deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the
war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million
civilians.[325][326][327] Many of the civilians died because of deliberate
genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.

The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war,[328] including
8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. The largest portion of
military dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic
Ukrainians.[329] A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were wounded or
killed.[330] Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the
Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.[331]

Of the total number of deaths in World War II, approximately 85 per
cent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the Allied side and 15 per cent were on
the Axis side.[332] Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed
by German and Japanese forces in occupied territories. An estimated 11[333] to
17 million[334] civilians died either as a direct or as an indirect result of
Nazi racist policies, including the Holocaust of around 6 million Jews, half
of whom were Polish citizens, along with a further minimum 1.9 million ethnic
Poles.[335][336] Millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and
Belarusians), Roma, homosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups were
also killed.[337][334] Hundreds of thousands (varying estimates) of ethnic
Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian
Ustaše in Yugoslavia,[338] and retribution-related killings were committed
just after the war ended.

Army, during the Nanking Massacre, December 1937

In Asia and the Pacific, between 3 million and more than 10 million civilians,
mostly Chinese (estimated at 7.5 million[339]), were killed by the Japanese
occupation forces.[340] The best-known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking
Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were
raped and murdered.[341] Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million
casualties occurred during the _Sankō Sakusen_. General Yasuji Okamura
implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung.[342]

Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese
Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of
China ( _seeUnit 731_ )[343][344] and in early conflicts against the
Soviets.[345] Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against
civilians[346] and, sometimes on prisoners of war.[347]

The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish
officers,[348] and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political
prisoners by the NKVD,[349] in the Baltic states, and eastern Poland annexed
by the Red Army.

The mass-bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war
crime. However, no positive or specific customary international humanitarian
law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II.[350]

### Genocide, concentration camps, and slave labour

camp, 1945

The German government led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was responsible
for the Holocaust, the killing of approximately 6 million Jews, as well as 2.7
million ethnic Poles,[351] and 4 million others who were deemed "unworthy of
life" (including the disabled and mentally ill, Soviet prisoners of war,
homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Romani) as part of a
programme of deliberate extermination. About 12 million, most of whom were
Eastern Europeans, were employed in the German war economy as forced
labourers.[352]

In addition to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) led
to the death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania,
Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet
citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis.[353]
Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war.[354] Richard
Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died
or were killed, a total of 3.6 million.[355] Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated
civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators,
and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.[356]

as forced labour to Auschwitz, December 1942

Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also
had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East
found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent (for American
POWs, 37 per cent),[357] seven times that of POWs under the Germans and
Italians.[358] While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the
Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the
surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56.[359]

According to historian Zhifen Ju, at least five million Chinese civilians from
northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East
Asia Development Board, or _Kōain_ , for work in mines and war industries.
After 1942, the number reached 10 million.[360] The US Library of Congress
estimates that in Java, between 4 and 10 million _rōmusha_ (Japanese: "manual
labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of
these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East
Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.[361]

On 19 February 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, interning about
100,000 Japanese living on the West Coast. Canada had a similar
programme.[362][363] In addition, 14,000 German and Italian citizens who had
been assessed as being security risks were also interned.[364]

In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the Yalta Conference millions
of POWs and civilians were used as forced labour by the Soviet Union.[365] In
Hungary's case, Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until
1955.[366]

### Occupation

Main articles: German-occupied Europe, Lebensraum, Untermensch, Collaboration
with the Axis Powers during World War II, Resistance during World War II, and
Nazi plunder

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central
Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions
of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it
collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end
of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial
products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[367] Thus, the
income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany
collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of
total German income as the war went on.[368]

Russian Academy of Sciences reported in 1995 civilian victims in the Soviet
Union at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68
million persons in the occupied USSR

In the East, the intended gains of _Lebensraum_ were never attained as
fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to
the German invaders.[369] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy
encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior
people" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass
executions.[370] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied
territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the
East[371] or the West[372] until late 1943.

In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which
it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.[373] Although
Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European
domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public
opinion against them within weeks.[374] During Japan's initial conquest it
captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m3) of oil (~5.5×105 tonnes) left behind
by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the
Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (~6.8×10 ~~^~~ 6 t), 76 per cent of
its 1940 output rate.[374]

### Home fronts and production

Main articles: Military production during World War II and Home front during
World War II

Allied to Axis GDP ratio

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant
advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies
(United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent
larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the
European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then
gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1
advantage in GDP.[375] In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times
the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced
to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese
colonies are included.[375]

The United States provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the
Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks,
and ammunition.[376] Though the Allies' economic and population advantages
were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany
and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States
and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of
attrition.[377] While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often
attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other
factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour
force,[378] Allied strategic bombing,[379] and Germany's late shift to a war
economy[380] contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor
Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.[381]
To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave
labourers;[382] Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern
Europe,[352] while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East
Asia.[360][361]

### Advances in technology and warfare

Main article: Technology during World War II

B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers on the Boeing assembly line in Wichita,
Kansas, 1944

Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-
support, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included airlift
(the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and
personnel);[383] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and
population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[384] Anti-
aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-
to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft
was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led
to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[385]

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with
aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively
little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and
the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of
the battleship.[386][387][388]

In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys,
increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-
Atlantic gap.[389] Carriers were also more economical than battleships because
of the relatively low cost of aircraft[390] and their not requiring to be as
heavily armoured.[391] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon
during the First World War,[392] were anticipated by all sides to be important
in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and
tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its
offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack
tactics.[393] Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh
light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.

Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War I to increased
mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for
infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary
weapon.[394] In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced
than it had been during World War I,[395] and advances continued throughout
the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.

At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by
tanks with superior specifications.[396] This idea was challenged by the poor
performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German
doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use
of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful
blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.[394] Many means of destroying
tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-
propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks
were used.[396] Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the
backbone of all forces,[397] and throughout the war, most infantry were
equipped similarly to World War I.[398]

The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG34, and
various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle
settings.[398] The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many
features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry
weapon for most armed forces.[399]

Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and
security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing
ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine.[400]
Development of SIGINT ( _sig_ nals _int_ elligence) and cryptanalysis enabled
the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied
decryption of Japanese naval codes[401] and British Ultra, a pioneering method
for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish
Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the
war.[402] Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception,
which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and
Bodyguard.[401][403] Other technological and engineering feats achieved
during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable
computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the
Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and
the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English
Channel.

committed to bomb Germany if it attacked Poland, but did not do so except for

The coup speeded the Red Army's advance, and the Soviet Union later awarded Michael the Order of Victory for his personal courage in overthrowing Antonescu and putting an end to Romania's war against the Allies.
