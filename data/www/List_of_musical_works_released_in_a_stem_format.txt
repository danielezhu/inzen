The following is a list of musical works that have been released legally in a stem format for public use.
With the growing availability of amateur music-making software such as GarageBand, it has become possible for consumers to more easily make their own music. In 2005, as an experiment, Trent Reznor released the stems to the single "The Hand That Feeds." Since then, other artists have begun releasing the stems for some songs, the intention being that listeners can freely remix and reuse the music in any way desired.
