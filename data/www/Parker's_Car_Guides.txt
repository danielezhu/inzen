Parker's Car Price Guide is a monthly magazine and, more recently, a website with reviews and price lists for new and used cars in the United Kingdom. Initial searches are free, with payment required to access further details.
It was founded in 1972 and is the longest-running price guide available to the public. It expanded over the years to offer reviews, technical data and marketplace intelligence along with pricing. The portfolio of products has been edited by Kieren Puffett since 2004.
More recently it has specialised in testing high-performance luxury cars, leaving reviews of more typical vehicles in car ownership to sister publications such as CAR magazine.
Parker's also offers valuations for commercial vehicles (vans and pick-ups), and the section is headed by Liam Campbell. Since 2008, Parker's is owned and published by the German company Bauer Media Group.
