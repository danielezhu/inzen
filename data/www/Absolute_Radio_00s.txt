Absolute Radio 00s, or Absolute Radio Noughties, is a spin-off service from Absolute Radio. In the same format as Absolute Radio 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the station is a rolling music service which airs music from the period 2000-present, focusing chiefly on rock, alternative, 'credible' pop and hip-hop/urban crossover music.
It launched on 10 December 2010 on the Switch London DAB multiplex, replacing Absolute Radio 90s which moved permanently to the national Digital One multiplex following a trial period. (Absolute 90s had only launched in the London slot a few months prior to this, following Absolute Radio 80s' move to Digital One.). In December 2014, Absolute 00s was withdrawn from DAB in London, as part of wider alterations, but simultaneously was made available, possibly on a temporary basis, on DAB in Inverness.
