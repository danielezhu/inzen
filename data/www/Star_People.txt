Star People is a 1983 album recorded by Miles Davis and issued by Columbia Records. It is the third release after the trumpeter's six-year hiatus. Beside the members of the band of We Want Miles the recordings feature John Scofield for the first time, who worked alongside Mike Stern in Davis's band in late 1982 and early 1983 before Stern's departure later in the year. Scofield was recommended by saxophonist Bill Evans. Marcus Miller played on five of the six tracks, but was replaced by Tom Barney on the most recent track of the album, "Speak", a live recording from February 1983 in Houston. Barney would be replaced later in 1983 by Darryl Jones. Al Foster and Mino Cinelu are heard on drums and percussion. Miles Davis plays trumpet and Oberheim synthesizer often at the same time (without using overdubs), and also on separately recorded interludes for the over-18-minute-long blues "Star People".
The album has also become part of the box set Miles Davis: The Complete Columbia Album Collection.
