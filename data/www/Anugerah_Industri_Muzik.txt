Anugerah Industri Muzik (Malay: Music Industry Award), commonly known by the acronym AIM, is the award ceremony to honour the Malaysian music industry and it' also organised by Recording Industry Association of Malaysia (RIM). It first held in 1993 and was held on 15 December of that year. It is Malaysia's equivalent of the Grammy awards. The award is not only focused on Malay-language music produced in Malaysia, but also English, Chinese and Indian language music as well, in which separate awards were introduced for the latter two language music subcategories in 1999 and 2013 respectively. (The former ceremony, known as the AIM Chinese Music Awards, had been held in 1999 and 2001 before encountering a twelve-year hiatus due to insufficient funds.)
The broadcaster of the award has been changed several times, varying between RTM, Media Prima and Astro. The earlier two awards are broadcast on television after the event, and the following event would be broadcast live through television.
Since its introduction, the award has been held every year, with the exception of 1994 and 2015, due to the changes in the month that the event would be held.
