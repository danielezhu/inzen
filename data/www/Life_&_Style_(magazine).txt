Life & Style, officially Life & Style Weekly, is an American celebrity gossip magazine, launched in 2004 by the Bauer publishing conglomerate.
Although it is celebrity-focused, the magazine is geared towards lifestyle trends, and bills itself on "helping readers incorporate" celebrity beauty, clothing and body trends into their own lifestyle. However, as of 2014 the focus has been more focused on celebrity news.
The magazine has the same publisher as its sister magazine In Touch Weekly, a similar weekly gossip magazine that is geared more towards celebrity news.
