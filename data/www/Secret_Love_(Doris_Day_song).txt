"Secret Love" is a song composed by Sammy Fain (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics)  for Calamity Jane, a 1953 musical film in which it was introduced by Doris Day in the title role. Ranked as a #1 hit for Day on both the Billboard and Cash Box, the song also afforded Day a #1 hit in the United States. "Secret Love" has subsequently been recorded by a wide range of artists, becoming a C&W hit firstly for Slim Whitman and later for Freddy Fender, with the song also becoming an R&B hit for Billy Stewart, whose version also reached the Top 40 as did Freddy Fender's. In the U.K., "Secret Love" would become the career record of Kathy Kirby via her 1963 remake of the song. The melody is based on the opening theme of Schubert's A-major piano sonata, D.664.
