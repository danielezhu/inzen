Jaco Pastorius is the solo debut album by Jaco Pastorius, released in 1976. The album was produced by Bobby Colomby, drummer and founder of Blood, Sweat & Tears.
The disc begins with a cover version of "Donna Lee" by Miles Davis, although it was mistakenly credited to Charlie Parker. Eight other tracks were written or co-written by Pastorius. For the 2007 reissue, two previously unreleased tracks were added.
