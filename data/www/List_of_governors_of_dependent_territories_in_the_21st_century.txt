Territorial governors in the 20th century – Current leaders of dependent territories – Current dependent territory leaders – Colonial and territorial governors by year
This is a list of territorial governors in the 21st century (2001–present) AD, such as the administrators of colonies, protectorates, or other dependencies. Where applicable, native rulers are also listed.
For the purposes of this list, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the 'parent' state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.
