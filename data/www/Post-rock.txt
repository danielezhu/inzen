Post-rock is a form of experimental rock characterized by the influence and use of instruments commonly associated with rock music, but using rhythms and "guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures" not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock bands are often instrumental. Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and early 1990s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of contemporary indie rock.
Prominent post-rock groups include Sigur RÃ³s, Explosions in the Sky, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Stereolab, Mogwai, Disco Inferno, and Tortoise, with individual styles between groups differing widely despite being centered on guitars and drums. As such, the term has been the subject of controversy from listeners and artists alike.
