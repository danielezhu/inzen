Afraid of Sunlight is the eighth studio album by the British neo-progressive rock band Marillion, released in 1995. Recorded at The Racket Club in Buckinghamshire between January and March 1995, it was produced by the band themselves and co-produced by Dave Meegan, as was the previous album, Brave (1994).
Despite being one of Marillion's most critically acclaimed albums, Afraid of Sunlight was their first to fail to reach the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 16 and falling out of the Top 40 after just two weeks. Disappointing sales led to EMI Records not extending the contract with the band. The label, however, would continue to release back-catalogue material on compilations and reissues, as well as distribute some later recordings.
