The Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS) is a copyright collective representing Australian and New Zealand music publishers since 1979. The society's head offices are located in Sydney, Australia where its "line of business includes owning or leasing franchises, patents, and copyrights which they in turn license others to use." It is a member of the Bureau International de l'Edition Mecanique (BIEM), the international mechanical rights coordinating organisation. AMCOS manages mechanical royalties, which is "the reproduction or copying and storage of music in different formats. This covers copying of songs and compositions by record labels or other parties to sell them on CD, DVD, online, for use as production music and for radio/TV programs."
Since 1997 the society has formed an alliance with Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), which represents composers and lyricists, to provide "a one-stop service to music creators and music customers." Together they present the APRA Music Awards in Australia and New Zealand from 1998.
