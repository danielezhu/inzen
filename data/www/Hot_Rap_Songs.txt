Hot Rap Songs (formerly known as Hot Rap Tracks and Hot Rap Singles) is a chart released weekly by Billboard in the United States. It lists the 25 most popular hip-hop/rap songs, calculated weekly by airplay on rhythmic and urban radio stations and sales in hip hop-focused or exclusive markets. Streaming data and digital downloads were added to the methodology of determining chart rankings in 2012. From 1989 through 2001, it was based on how much the single sold in that given week. The most weeks at number one was "Hot Boyz" by Missy Elliott featuring Nas, Eve and Q-Tip, that was number one for 19 weeks from December 1999 to March 2000. The current number one is "I'm The One" by DJ Khaled featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper & Lil Wayne.
