Written on the Wind is a 1956 American Technicolor drama film directed by Douglas Sirk starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone.
The screenplay by George Zuckerman was based on Robert Wilder's 1945 novel of the same name, a thinly disguised account of the real-life scandal involving torch singer Libby Holman and her husband, tobacco heir Zachary Smith Reynolds. Zuckerman shifted the locale from North Carolina to Texas, made the source of the family wealth oil rather than tobacco, and changed all the character names.
