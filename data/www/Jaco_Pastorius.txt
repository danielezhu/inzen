John Francis Anthony "Jaco" Pastorius III (, December 1, 1951 â€“ September 21, 1987) was an American jazz bass guitarist who was a member of Weather Report from 1976 to 1981. He worked with Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, and recorded albums as a solo artist and band leader. His bass playing employed funk, lyrical solos, bass chords, and innovative harmonics. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1988, one of only seven bassists so honored (and the only bass guitarist).
