PolyGram was a Dutch entertainment company, a division of Seagram. It started as a major record label recording company founded by Philips and Siemens as a holding company for their music interests in 1972. The name was chosen to reflect the Siemens interest Polydor Records and the Philips interest Phonogram Records The company traced its origins through Deutsche Grammophon back to the inventor of the flat disk gramophone, Emil Berliner. Later on, PolyGram expanded into the largest global entertainment company, creating film and television divisions.
In May 1998, it was sold to Seagram which owned MCA Inc. PolyGram was merged into Universal Music Group, and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment was merged into Universal Pictures. When the new company faced financial difficulties, its parent Seagram was sold in large part to Vivendi, and MCA became known as Universal Studios, as Seagram ceased to exist. Vivendi is the current owner of UMG; Comcast is the current owner of the media conglomerate now known as NBCUniversal.
In February 2017, PolyGram Entertainment was re-launched as the film & television division of Universal Music Group.
