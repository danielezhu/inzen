Post-production, or postproduction, is part of the process of filmmaking, video production, and photography. It occurs in the making of motion pictures, television programs, radio programs, advertising, audio recordings, photography, and digital art. Post-production includes all stages of production occurring after shooting or recording individual program segments.
Traditional (analogue) post-production has mostly been replaced by video editing software that operates on a non-linear editing system (NLE).
