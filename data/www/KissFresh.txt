KISS FRESH is a sister station to Kiss playing 'non-stop new beats including hip-hop, R&B, EDM, House and Garage'.
Initially provided over Freeview (replacing Smash Hits Radio) and online, the station was made available via digital radio in the London area, alongside sister station Kisstory, from 12 December 2014.
The DAB availability of KissFresh extended beyond London from 1 May 2016, with the station being made available in some (but not all) of the areas previously served by Kisstory on local DAB, this capacity having been released following the migration of Kisstory to Sound Digital.
