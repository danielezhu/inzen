An effects cymbal is a cymbal used in a drum kit for a special effect or accent. Effects cymbals include splash cymbals, china cymbals and many other less common types.
This classification is widely accepted but enigmatic. When pang and swish cymbals are used as ride cymbals they are not considered effects cymbals, despite their exotic tone. On the other hand, the most common six-piece cymbal setup consists of hi-hats, ride cymbal, two crash cymbals of slightly different sizes and possibly weights, one splash and one china type, so effects cymbals must be considered a standard part of an extended drum kit.
