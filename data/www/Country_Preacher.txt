Country Preacher is a live album recorded by the Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1969.
Recorded at an unidentified church meeting of the Chicago chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Operation Breadbasket, the album spent two months in the Cash Box R&B charts in 1970.
Described by discographer and Adderley biographer Chris Sheridan as "an audible sociological record", the introduction is by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The liner notes, written by Adderley, give some background to Operation Breadbasket and the Country Preacher.
The album is the first with bassist Booker as a member of the Quintet.
Adderley, in his introduction to the title track, makes a specific mention of fellow saxophonist Ben Branch, the director of the Operation Breadbasket Orchestra and Choir.
