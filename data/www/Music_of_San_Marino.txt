San Marino is a small sovereign state located within the territory of Italy. It has a musical heritage which includes the 17th-century composer Francesco Maria Marini di Pesaro and the 20th-century composer Cesare Franchini Tassini (1925â€“2010).
Since 1894, a wordless composition by Federico Consolo has been the national anthem of San Marino. The piece is based on a 10th-century choral composition. The previous anthem was by Aur. Muccioli and U. Balsimelli, and is similar to the Italian national anthem.
The modern military forces of San Marino parade through the streets in full uniform several times a day, accompanied by the sounds of a military brass band.
There is a small metal scene with Necrofilia and Nothing Inside Eyes the latter being formed from another band called Alchimia 2012.
