The Benidorm International Song Festival or Festival Internacional de la Canción de Benidorm (in Spanish) was an annual song contest which used to take place each summer, from 1959 to 2006, in the city of Benidorm, Spain. The contest, based on the Italian Sanremo Music Festival, was born to promote Benidorm and the Spanish music. Over the years it has suffered considerable modifications: some editions didn't celebrate, several changes have been done in the prizes, etc. It became international in 2004, but was discontinued after 2006. The contest was usually broadcast on television by TVE or Canal Nou. As of 2006, the first prize winner was awarded with the Golden Mermaid Trophy (Sirenita de Oro) and €36,000 (about US$47,000) to produce a record. Second and third place winners received the Silver Mermaid Trophy (Sirenita de Plata) and the Bronze Mermaid Trophy (Sirenita de Bronce), respectively.
