The Awit Awards are music awards in the Philippines given annually by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) to recognize the outstanding achievements in the music industry. The word "Awit" means "song" literally in Tagalog.
The first awards were given in 1969 at a ceremony in Makati. After three awards ceremonies were held, the Awit Awards were discontinued in 1972. In 1988, PARI brought back the awards and today, the organization still handles these awards.
