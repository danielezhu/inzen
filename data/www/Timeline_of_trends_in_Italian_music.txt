Timeline for Music of Italy
Dates for musical periods such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc. are somewhat arbitrary.
All dates are CE.

c. 425 — Cassian, Bishop of Brescia, adapts Egyptian monastic psalmody to Western usage.
476 — Rome falls to the Ostrogoths, which is often used to mark the beginning of the Middle Ages.

c. 500-c. 1400 Italian Medieval Music.
c. 530 — St. Benedict arranges the weekly order of monastic psalmody in his Rule.
530-609 — Venantius Fortunatus creates some of Christianity's most enduring hymns, including "Vexilla regis prodeunt," later the most popular hymn of the Crusades.
536 — Under Justinian's orders, Belisarius recaptures Rome from the Ostrogoths and reestablishes Byzantine rule in Italy. Northern Italy soon falls to the Lombards.
590-604 — Reign of Pope Gregory the Great, who reformed Church bureaucracy and unified the liturgy. Carolingian chant would later, somewhat misleadingly, be called Gregorian chant in his honor.
c. 650 — The Roman schola cantorum, the trained papal choir, is founded.
c. 700 — Pope Sergius I introduces the Agnus dei into the Roman Mass.
early 8th century — The Roman Stational Mass is recorded, in which the Pope presided over Masses in a series of cities.
785-6 — At Charlemagne's request, Pope Hadrian I sends a papal sacramentary with Roman chant, which only includes certain major holy days, to the Carolingian court in Francia. Charlemagne assigns Alcuin the task of completing an official compendium of Roman chants for the whole year. This led to the introduction of Gallican elements into the Roman chant cycle, creating Carolingian chant, later called Gregorian chant.
mid-9th century — Moslems invade Italy, taking Sicily and pressing as far north as Rome.
998 - Pope Gregory V requests a copy of the Reichenau sacramentary, typifying the collapse of the manuscript tradition in Italy and the power shift to the Ottonian Holy Roman Empire.
11th century — The first extant Ambrosian chants are written down. The Milanese chronicler Landulphus relates the tale that Charlemagne placed a Gregorian and an Ambrosian sacramentary side by side on an altar. When they both flew open together, it was a sign that both traditions were valid. Milanese chant is the only non-Gregorian chant tradition to survive in the West.
1014 — At his imperial coronation Mass, the German Holy Roman Emperor Henry II asks for the Credo to be sung, as was the custom in German Masses. This was the last of the ordinary chants to be added to the Roman Mass.
c. 1020 — Guido d'Arezzo describes the musical staff, solmization, and the Guidonian hand in his Micrologus. This early form of do-re-mi created a technical revolution in the speed at which chants could be learned, memorized, and transmitted.
1058 — Pope Stephen IX outlaws the local Beneventan chant of Benevento and Montecassino.
1197-1250 — Frederick II, the last great Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, encourages music at the Sicilian court. Sicily becomes a refuge for troubadours displaced by the Albigensian Crusade and a melting pot of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim musical styles.
13th century — The local chant tradition of Rome, which scholars now call Old Roman chant, gives way to Gregorian chant.
1209-29 — The Albigensian Crusade. Supposedly to attack Cathar heretics, it brought southern France under northern French control and crushed Occitan culture and language. Most troubadours fled, especially to Spain and Italy.
c. 1250-1350 — Italian flagellants develop the Italian folk hymns known as spiritual laude.
mid-13th century — Sordello of Mantua active as a trovatore, an Italian troubadour.
1265-1321 — Dante Alighieri. Dante champions the poetic use of the vernacular tongue. Strongly influenced by troubadour culture, he analyzed the troubadour verse forms, included troubadours and trovatori in the Divine Comedy, and strongly considered writing in Occitan rather than Tuscan.
1304-74 — The Italian poet Petrarch, whose poems were frequently set to music.
1317-c. 1319 — Marchettus of Padua writes major treatises on plainchant and polyphony, expounding a theory of rhythmic notation that paved the way for trecento (Italian ars nova) music.
