The airplay music charts in South Africa are gathered and published by the company Entertainment Monitoring Africa (EMA), formerly known as Mediaguide South Africa. It is a member of the Times Media Group, under Entertainment Logistics Services (ELS). The company provides a weekly top 10 airplay chart, which is available for viewing by the general public online. A top 100 is available for subscribed users of the company's website. The first top 10 airplay chart under the EMA was issued for May 21, 2013, with its first number one single being "Blurred Lines" by Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams. In 2014, the City Press wrote that the EMA charts were "regarded as the industry standard when it comes to tracking what songs are being played on radio". EMA currently monitors 48 radio stations and 8 television stations.
