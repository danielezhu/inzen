The Geffen Film Company (also known as The Geffen Company, The Geffen Film Company, Inc., and later Geffen Pictures) was a film distributor and production company founded by David Geffen, the founder of Geffen Records, and future co-founder of DreamWorks. Geffen founded the company in 1980, having recruited Eric Eisner as president, and distributed its films through Warner Bros. Geffen operated it as a division of Warner Bros., and as a result, following The Geffen Film Company's shutdown in 1998, Warner Bros. now owns the company's library. However, the only Geffen Film Company title Warner Bros. does not own is the 1996 Mike Judge comedy Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, itself owned by Paramount Pictures.
The spherical Geffen Pictures logo (based on the logo of its record-label counterpart) was created by Saul Bass.
