Reggae rock is a subgenre of reggae fusion and rock music that primarily uses the genres reggae, rock and ska. The term "reggae rock" has been used to categorize bands like The Police, Sublime, Sublime with Rome, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, The Expendables, Iration, the Dirty Heads, Rebelution, 311 and, to some extent, heavier bands such as Fishbone and Bad Brains. The term "reggae metal" has been used to describe bands that combine reggae rock with heavy metal, such as Dub War, Skindred and Zeroscape. Reggae rock found its rise in popularity in the 1990s in Long Beach, California, with the band Sublime. The genre has lately found a boost in popularity with the 2010 song "Lay Me Down" by the Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez from Sublime with Rome, which peaked at number 1 on both the US Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts.
