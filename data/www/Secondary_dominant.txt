Secondary dominant (also applied dominant, artificial dominant, or borrowed dominant) is an analytical label for a specific harmonic device that is prevalent in the tonal idiom of Western music beginning in the common practice period. In the tonal idiom, a song or piece of music has a tonic note and chord, which is based on the root of the key that the piece is in. The most important chords in a tonal song or piece are the tonic chord (labeled as I in harmonic analysis) and the dominant chord (V). In the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major and the dominant chord is G.
A secondary dominant refers to a dominant triad or seventh chord set to resolve to a degree that is not the tonic, with V(7)/V (V[7] of V), the dominant of the dominant, being the most frequently encountered example. The chord a secondary dominant progresses to can be thought of as a briefly tonicized chord; that is the chord that the secondary dominant resolves to, which sounds momentarily like a tonic to the listener. Tonicizations longer than a phrase can be regarded as modulations to a new key (or new tonic).
"The purpose of the secondary dominant is to place emphasis on a chord within the diatonic progression." "Functioning secondary dominants are used when a composer wants to inject a greater feeling of movement into a diatonic progression." The secondary-dominant terminology is still usually applied even if the chord resolution is nonfunctional (for example, the V/ii label is still used even if the V/ii chord is not followed by ii).
