The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of singles or albums in the United States and elsewhere. The results are published in Billboard magazine. Billboard biz, the online extension of the Billboard charts, provides additional weekly charts. There are also Year End charts. The charts may be dedicated to specific genre such as R&B, country or rock, or they may cover all genres. The charts can be ranked according to sales, streams or airplay, and for main song charts such as the Hot 100 song chart, all three pools of data are used to compiled the charts. For the Billboard 200 album chart, streams and track sales are included in addition to album sales.
The weekly sales and streams charts are monitored on a Friday to Thursday cycle since July 2015, previously it was on a Monday to Sunday cycle. Radio airplay song charts however follows the Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday). The charts are updated the following Tuesday, but dated the Saturday a further week (i.e. 11 days) later.
