Rider is a publishing imprint of Ebury Publishing, a Penguin Random House division. The list was started by William Rider & Son in Britain in 1908 when he took over the occult publisher Phillip Wellby. The editorial director of the new list was Ralph Shirley and under his direction, they began to publish titles as varied as the Rider-Waite tarot deck and Bram Stoker's Dracula.
Today the Rider motto is "New Ideas for New Ways of Living" and books and authors on the list reflects this. There are still books on the paranormal, with authors like Raymond Moody and Colin Fry; on astral projection with authors Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward Carrington; and spirituality, with books by the Dalai Lama and Jack Kornfield; but there are also books on current and international affairs by authors as diverse as Nobel Prize-winners Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Shirin Ebadi.
