_**Academic Ranking of World Universities**_ ( **ARWU** ), also known as
**Shanghai Ranking** , is an annual publication of university rankings by
Shanghai Ranking Consultancy.[1] The league table was originally compiled and
issued by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2003, the first global ranking with
multifarious indicators,[2] after which a board of international advisories
was established to provide suggestions.[3][4] The publication currently
includes global league tables for institutions and a whole and for a selection
of individual subjects, alongside independent regional _Greater China Ranking_
and _Macedonian HEIs Ranking_. ARWU is regarded as one of the three most
influential and widely observed university measures, alongside _QS World
University Rankings_ and _Times Higher Education World University
Rankings_.[5][6][7] It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some
condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining
humanities and quality of instruction.[8][6][9][10]

#### Reception[edit]

ARWU is praised by several media and institutions for its methodology and
influence. A survey on higher education published by _The Economist_ in 2005
commented ARWU as "the most widely used annual ranking of the world's research
universities."[12] In 2010, _The Chronicle of Higher Education_ called ARWU
"the best-known and most influential global ranking of universities".[13] EU
Research Headlines reported the ARWU's work on 31 December 2003: "The
universities were carefully evaluated using several indicators of research
performance."[14] Chancellor of University of Oxford, Chris Patten and former
Vice-Chancellor of Australian National University, Ian Chubb, said: "the
methodology looks fairly solid ... it looks like a pretty good stab at a fair
comparison." and "The SJTU rankings were reported quickly and widely around
the world… (and they) offer an important comparative view of research
performance and reputation." respectively.[15] Philip G. Altbach named ARWU's
'consistency, clarity of purpose, and transparency' as significant
strengths.[16] Whilst ARWU has originated in China, the ranking have been
praised for being unbiased towards Asian institutions.[17]

####  Criticism[edit]

The ranking is condemned for "relying too much on award factors" thus
undermining the importance of quality of instruction and
humanities.[8][6][18][19] A 2007 paper published in the journal
_Scientometrics_ found that the results from the Shanghai rankings could not
be reproduced from raw data using the method described by Liu and Cheng.[20] A
2013 paper in the same journal finally showed how the Shanghai ranking results
could be reproduced.[21] In a report from April 2009, J-C. Billaut, D.
Bouyssou and Ph. Vincke analyse how the ARWU works, using their insights as
specialists of Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Their main
conclusions are that the criteria used are not relevant; that the aggregation
methodology has a number of major problems; and that insufficient attention
has been paid to fundamental choices of criteria.[22] The ARWU researchers
themselves, N.C Liu and Y Cheng, think that the quality of universities cannot
be precisely measured by mere numbers and any ranking must be controversial.
They suggest that university and college rankings should be used with caution
and their methodologies must be understood clearly before reporting or using
the results. ARWU has been criticised by the European Commission as well as
some EU member states for "favour[ing] Anglo-Saxon higher education
institutions". For instance, ARWU is repeatedly criticised in France, where it
triggers an annual controversy, focusing on its ill-adapted character to the
French academic system[23][24] and the unreasonable weight given to research
often performed decades ago.[25] It is also criticised in France for its use
as a motivation for fusing universities into larger ones.[26] Indeed, a
further criticism has been that the metrics used are not independent of
university size, e.g. number of publications or award winners will
mechanically add as universities are grouped, independently of research (or
teaching) quality; thus a merger between two equally-ranked institutions will
almost double the merged institutions score and give it a higher ranking,
without any change in quality.[10]

### Alternative[edit]

As it may take much time for rising universities to produce Nobel laureates
and Fields Medalists with numbers comparable to those of older institutions,
the Institute created alternative rankings excluding such award factors so as
to provide another way of comparisons of academic performance. The weighting
of all the other factors remains unchanged, thus the grand total of 70%.

Alternative Rankings (500) – Top 10[Note 2] Institution | 2014[28] | 2015[29]

University of California, San Diego | 7 | 8  
University of Washington | 10 | 9  
Yale University | 9 | 10  
  
### Subject[edit]

There are two categories in ARWU's disciplinary rankings, broad subject fields
and specific subjects. The methodology is similar to that adopted in the
overall table, including award factors, paper citation, and the number of
highly cited scholars.

Broad fields[30] | Specific subjects[31]  
---|---  
Natural sciences and mathematics | Mathematics  
Computer science and engineering | Physics  
Life and agricultural sciences | Chemistry  
Clinical medicine and pharmacy | Computer science  
Social sciences | Economics and business  
  
## Regional rankings[edit]

Considering the development of specific areas, two independent regional league
tables with different methodologies were launched.[ _citation needed_ ]

It is a remarkably stable list, relying on long-term factors such as the number of Nobel Prize-winners a university has produced, and number of articles published in Nature and Science journals. But with this narrow focus comes drawbacks. China's priority was for its universities to 'catch up' on hard scientific research. So if you're looking for raw research power, it's the list for you. If you're a humanities student, or more interested in teaching quality? Not so much.

ARWU presents a further data issue. Whereas in the case of the other rankings the results are adjusted to take account of the size of institutions, hardly any such adjustment is made by ARWU. So there is a distortion in favour of large institutions. If two institutions were to merge, the very fact of merger would mean that the merged institution would do nearly twice as well as either of the individual institutions prior to merger, although nothing else had changed.
