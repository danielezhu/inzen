The United Paramount Network (UPN) was an American broadcast television network that launched on January 16, 1995. The network was originally owned by Chris-Craft Industries/United Television; then Viacom (through its Paramount Television unit, which produced most of the network's series) turned the network into a joint venture in 1996 after acquiring a 50% stake in the network, and then purchased Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. In December 2005, UPN was spun off to CBS Corporation when CBS and Viacom split up into two separate companies.
CBS Corporation and Time Warner jointly announced in January 2006 that the companies would shut down UPN and competitor The WB to launch a new joint venture network later that year. UPN ceased broadcasting on September 15, 2006, and The WB ended two days later. Select programs from both networks moved to the new network, The CW, when it launched on September 18, 2006.
