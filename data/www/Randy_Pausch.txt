**Randolph Frederick Pausch**[3] (October 23, 1960  – July 25, 2008) was an
American professor of computer science, human–computer interaction, and design
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pausch learned that he had pancreatic cancer in September 2006, and in August
2007, he was given a terminal diagnosis: "3 to 6 months of good health left".
He gave an upbeat lecture titled "The Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your
Childhood Dreams" on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon, which became a
popular YouTube video and led to other media appearances. He then co-authored
a book called _The Last Lecture_ on the same theme, which became a _New York
Times_ best-seller.

Pausch died of complications from pancreatic cancer on July 25, 2008.

## Early life[edit]

Pausch was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in Columbia, Maryland.[3]
After graduating from Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Pausch received
his bachelor's degree in computer science from Brown University in May 1982
and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in August
1988.[4][ _not in citation given_ ] While completing his doctoral studies,
Pausch was briefly employed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Adobe
Systems.[5]

## Computer science career[edit]

Pausch was an assistant and associate professor in the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied
Science from 1988 until 1997. While there, he completed sabbaticals at Walt
Disney Imagineering and Electronic Arts (EA). In 1997, Pausch became Associate
Professor of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design at
Carnegie Mellon University. In 1998, he was a co-founder, along with Don
Marinelli, of CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), and he started the
Building Virtual Worlds[6] course at CMU, which he taught for 10 years. He
consulted with Google on user interface design and also consulted with PARC,
Imagineering, and Media Metrix.[5] Pausch is also the founder of the Alice
software project.[7] He received the National Science Foundation Presidential
Young Investigator Award and was a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow.[8] Pausch
was the author or co-author of five books and over 70 articles.

Pausch received two awards from ACM in 2007 for his achievements in computing
education: the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award and the ACM
Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education Award for Outstanding
Contributions to Computer Science Education.[9] He was also inducted as a
Fellow of the ACM in 2007.

## Cancer and death[edit]

Pausch was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer[10][11] and underwent a Whipple
procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) on September 19, 2006, in an unsuccessful
attempt to halt the disease.[12] He was told in August 2007 to expect a
remaining three to six months of good health. He soon moved his family to
Chesapeake, Virginia, to be close to his wife's family. On March 13, 2008,
Pausch advocated for greater federal funding for pancreatic cancer before the
United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human
Services, Education, and Related Agencies.[13] In the week prior to this, he
had been hospitalized in order to have needle aspiration of pleural effusion
in his right lung.[14]

On May 2, 2008, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed that he had
very tiny (5 millimetres (0.20 in) or less) metastases in his lungs and in
some of the lymph nodes in his chest. He also had metastases in his peritoneal
and retroperitoneal cavities. On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was
considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse
side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based
approaches.[15] On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a
message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the
cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and
that Pausch had "taken a step down" and was "much sicker than he had been".
The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a hospice program
designed to provide palliative care to those at the end of life.[15]

Pausch died from pancreatic cancer at his family's home in Chesapeake,
Virginia, on July 25, 2008, at the age of 47. He is survived by his wife, Jai,
and their three children, Dylan, Logan, and Chloe.[16]

## "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"[edit]

Main article: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams

Pausch delivered his "Last Lecture", titled "Really Achieving Your Childhood
Dreams", at CMU on September 18, 2007.[17] He gave an abridged version of his
speech on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ in October 2007.[18][19] The talk was
modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to
think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical "final
talk", with a topic such as "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world
if you knew it was your last chance?" Before speaking, Pausch received a long
standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students. When
he motioned them to sit down, saying, "Make me earn it", someone in the
audience shouted back, "You did!"[10][20]

During the lecture, Pausch offered inspirational life lessons, and performed
push-ups on stage. He also commented on the irony that the "Last Lecture"
series had recently been renamed as "Journeys", saying, "I thought, damn, I
finally nailed the venue and they renamed it."[16] After Pausch finished his
lecture, Steve Seabolt, on behalf of Electronic Arts—which is now
collaborating with CMU in the development of Alice 3.0[21]—pledged to honor
Pausch by creating a memorial scholarship for women in computer science, in
recognition of Pausch's support and mentoring of women in CS and
engineering.[10]

CMU president Jared Cohon spoke emotionally of Pausch's humanity and called
his contributions to the university and to education "remarkable and
stunning".[22] He then announced that CMU will celebrate Pausch's impact on
the world by building and naming after Pausch a raised pedestrian bridge[23]
to connect CMU's new Computer Science building and the Center for the Arts,
symbolizing the way Pausch linked those two disciplines. Brown University
professor Andries van Dam followed Pausch's last lecture with a tearful and
impassioned speech praising him for his courage and leadership, calling him a
role model.[22][24][25]

The Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge was dedicated on October 30, 2009, with
Jai, Dylan, Logan, and Chloe Pausch cutting the ribbon.

### _The Last Lecture_ [edit]

Main article: The Last Lecture

The Disney-owned publisher Hyperion paid $6.7 million for the rights to
publish a book about Pausch called _The Last Lecture_ , co-authored by Pausch
and _Wall Street Journal_ reporter Jeffrey Zaslow.[26] The book became a _New
York Times_ best-seller on April 28, 2008.[27] _The Last Lecture_ expands on
Pausch's speech. The book's first printing had 400,000 copies, and it has been
translated into 46 languages. It has spent more than 85 weeks on the _New York
Times_ bestseller list, and there are now more than 4.5 million copies in
print in the U.S. alone. Despite speculation that the book would be made into
a movie, Pausch had denied these rumors, stating that "there's a reason to do
the book, but if it's telling the story of the lecture in the medium of film,
we already have that."[28]

###  Media coverage[edit]

Pausch was named "Person of the Week" on ABC's World News with Charles Gibson
on September 21, 2007.[29] His "Last Lecture" attracted wide attention from
the international media,[30] became an Internet hit, and was viewed over a
million times in the first month after its delivery.[31] On October 22, 2007,
Pausch appeared on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ where he discussed his situation
and summarized his "Last Lecture".[19] On October 6, 2007, Pausch joined the
Pittsburgh Steelers for the day during their regular practice, after the
organization learned that one of his childhood dreams mentioned in his "Last
Lecture" was to play in the NFL.[32] On April 9, 2008, the ABC network aired
an hour-long Diane Sawyer feature on Pausch titled "The Last Lecture: A Love
Story For Your Life".[33][34] On July 29, 2008, ABC aired a follow-up to the
Last Lecture special, remembering Pausch and his famous lecture.[35]

###  Other lectures and appearances[edit]

Pausch gave a lecture about time management[36] on November 27, 2007 at the
University of Virginia, to an audience of over 850 people.[37] In March 2008,
Pausch appeared in a public service announcement video[38] and testified
before Congress in support of cancer research.[39] On May 18, 2008, Pausch
made a surprise return appearance at Carnegie Mellon, giving a speech at the
commencement ceremony,[40] as well as attending the School of Computer
Science's diploma ceremony,[41] and on May 19 Pausch appeared on the show
_Good Morning America_.[42] His lecture, "Really Achieving Your Childhood
Dreams", was nominated at the 2007 YouTube Video Awards.[43][44]

A devoted _Star Trek_ fan, Pausch was invited by film director J. J. Abrams to
film a role in _Star Trek_. Abrams heard of Pausch's condition and sent a
personal e-mail inviting Pausch to the set. Pausch accepted and traveled to
Los Angeles, California, to shoot his scene. In addition to appearing in the
film, he also has a line of dialogue at the beginning of the film ("Captain,
we have visual.") and donated the $217.06 paycheck to charity.[45][46]
