The Official Subscription Plays Chart was a music chart based on the number of plays of songs on subscription-based services in the United Kingdom. It was compiled weekly by the Official Charts Company (OCC), until November 2013. Each week's number one was published on a dedicated webpage of the OCC's official websiteâ€”this webpage first went live in mid-2009.
