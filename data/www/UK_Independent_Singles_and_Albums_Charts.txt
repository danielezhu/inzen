The UK Independent Singles Chart and UK Independent Albums Chart are charts of the best-selling independent singles and albums, respectively, in the United Kingdom. Originally published in 1980, the relevance of the chart dwindled in the 1990s as major-label ownership blurred the boundary between independent and major labels. Independent charts are currently published weekly by the Official Charts Company.
