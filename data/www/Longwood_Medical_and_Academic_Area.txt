The Longwood Medical and Academic Area (also known as Longwood Medical Area, LMA, or simply Longwood) is a medical campus in Boston, Massachusetts. Flanking Longwood Avenue, as it runs from Huntington Avenue to The Riverway, LMA is adjacent to the Fenwayâ€“Kenmore, Audubon Circle, and Mission Hill neighborhoods, and the town of Brookline.
It is most strongly associated with the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and other medical facilities such as Harvard's teaching hospitals, but prominent non-Harvard institutions are located there as well, such as Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, museums, liberal arts colleges, and research centers.
