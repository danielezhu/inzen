From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research is one of the principal facilities
of the Mellon College of Science

The **Mellon College of Science** (MCS) at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA houses the Chemistry, Mathematical Sciences,
Physics, and Biological Sciences departments. In addition, it oversees several
interdisciplinary research centers. MCS also awards the Dickson Prize in
Science. The college is named for the Mellon family, founders of the Mellon
Institute of Industrial Research, a predecessor of Carnegie Mellon University.

The college offers various bachelor, master, and doctorate programs. Since
2016, its dean is Rebecca Doerge.[1]

Note: While the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition is actually in the
Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Center (which is also
a faculty-appointing institute) has close ties to the Mellon College of
Science
