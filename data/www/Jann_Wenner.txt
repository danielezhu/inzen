Jann Simon Wenner (born January 7, 1946) is the co-founder and publisher of the popular culture biweekly magazine Rolling Stone, and current owner of Men's Journal magazine. Born in New York City, Wenner graduated from Chadwick School and later attended the University of California, Berkeley. He dropped out, but while at Berkeley he participated in the Free Speech Movement. Wenner, with his mentor Ralph J. Gleason, co-founded Rolling Stone in 1967 with the help of a loan from family members and his soon to be wife. Later in his career, several musicians would allege that Wenner was unfairly biased against their work, which hindered their induction into the Hall of Fame. Wenner received the Norman Mailer Prize in 2010 for his work in the publishing industry. His networth is estimated to be $700 Million.
