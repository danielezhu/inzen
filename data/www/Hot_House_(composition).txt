"Hot House" is a bebop standard, composed by American jazz musician Tadd Dameron in 1945. Its harmonic structure is identical to Cole Porter's "What Is This Thing Called Love?" (see contrafact). The tune was made famous by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker as a quintet arrangement and become synonymous with those musicians; "Hot House" became an anthem of the Be-bop movement in American jazz. The most famous and referred to recording of the tune is by Parker and Gillespie on the May 1953 live concert recording entitled Jazz at Massey Hall. The tune continues to be a favorite among jazz musicians and enthusiasts:
In 1982, Chaka Khan covered the tune as part of "Be Bop Medley," on her album Chaka Khan.
In 1990, Mal Waldron & Steve Lacy covered the tune on their album Hot House.
In 1999, guitarist Larry Coryell covered the tune on his album Private Concert.
In 2001 it was arranged for big band for Warner Brothers Publications; this was recorded later on the big band CD Up Your Brass.
In 2010, tenor saxophonist James Moody performed the tune on his Grammy-winning final recording Moody 4B.
