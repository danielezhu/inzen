"It Would Be So Nice" is a 1968 song by the rock band, Pink Floyd, written by the keyboard player/singer Richard Wright. It was the fourth single released by the group. The song was left out of the 1971 collection Relics and, prior to the release of The Early Singles in 1992 with the box set Shine On, it was only available on the Masters of Rock compilation and the famous bootleg Dark Side of the Moo. Its B-side, "Julia Dream", was written by the bass guitarist Roger Waters (who was gradually transitioning into his eventual role as the predominant songwriter and vocalist) and was also re-released on The Early Singles.
