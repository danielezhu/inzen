**Mellon Institute of Industrial Research** , founded in 1913 by Andrew W.
Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology
in 1967 to form Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United
States. While it ceased to exist as a distinct institution, the landmark
building bearing its name remains located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and
Bellefield Avenue in Oakland, the city's university district. It is sited
adjacent to The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and the
University of Pittsburgh's Bellefield Hall and is across Bellefield Avenue
from two other local landmarks: the University of Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial
Chapel and the Cathedral of Learning.

Designed by architect Benno Janssen (1874–1964), it is noted for its neo-
classical architecture and elegant construction, with its signature monolithic
limestone columns (the largest monolithic columns in the world)[3]. Andrew
Mellon, who served as United States Secretary of the Treasury, specified to
Janssen a building with a monumental ionic colonnade similar to the Treasury
Building in Washington, D.C.. The proportions of Mellon Institute's street
facades are nearly those of the long lateral facade of the Parthenon on the
Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Mellon Institute was completed and dedicated
posthumously to the Mellon brothers in May 1937.

Mellon Institute currently houses the Office of the Dean for Carnegie Mellon
University's Mellon College of Science, as well as the administrative offices
and research laboratories for the Department of Biological Sciences and
Department of Chemistry. From 1986 until 2006, it also housed the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center.

## History[edit]

The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was first established as the
Department of Industrial Research at the neighboring University of Pittsburgh.
It conducted research for firms on a contractual basis; a company would
contract the institute to solve a specific problem, and the institute would
then hire an appropriate scientist to do the research. The results of the
research then became the property of the contracting company.

In 1928, the institute was incorporated as a nonprofit, independent research
center and planning for a new Mellon Institute building began that same year.
When completed in 1937, the institute moved into its new building which sat
directly across from the newly completed Cathedral of Learning, and handed its
original facility, now known as Allen Hall, back to the University of
Pittsburgh. The original design called for two more pillars than architect
Janssen decided on. The two extra pillars were buried in the large lawn beside
the Cathedral of Learning. The pillars are set to be unburied in 2014 as a new
pipe system is installed in the basement of the Cathedral.[4]

In 1967, declining use of independent research institutes for the outsourcing
of corporate industrial research led Mellon Institute to merge with the
Carnegie Institute of Technology to form Carnegie Mellon University. The
"Carnegie Institute of Technology" name was retained to refer to the
engineering portion of Carnegie Mellon's "College of Engineering and Science".

In 2013, the American Chemical Society recognized the Mellon Institute as a
National Historic Chemical Landmark for its contributions to industrial
research and training from its inception in 1913 until its merger with the
Carnegie Institute of Technology. Researchers at the Mellon Institute had
contributed more than 4,700 papers, 1,600 patents, and other research
products, including George O. Curme, Jr.'s discovery of a method for producing
acetylene from petroleum that resulted in the production of ethylene and
research in organosilicones and the resulting establishment of the Dow Corning
Corporation.[5]

For decades, the columns of the Mellon Institute building have served as a
popular background for photographers shooting Pittsburgh wedding parties.

## Fictional portrayals[edit]

  * Exterior shots of the Mellon Institute were used to portray the fictitious Tanner Museum in the series premiere of the short-lived 2006 CBS television drama _Smith_ starring Ray Liotta and Amy Smart.
  * The 1990 film _Citizen Cohn_ starring James Woods used the exterior to depict 1960s-era Washington, D.C.
  * The 1992 film _Hoffa_ starring Danny DeVito and Jack Nicholson filmed on location to depict Federal Courthouses and other government buildings.
  * The 1992 film _Lorenzo's Oil_ shows an interior shot of a lecture hall in Mellon Institute.
  * The 2002 film _The Mothman Prophecies_ starring Richard Gere depicted the building as a fictional institute for paranormal studies in Chicago.
  * The 2012 film _The Dark Knight Rises_ starring Christian Bale filmed on location to depict "Gotham City Hall".
