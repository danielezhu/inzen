They Call Me Mister Tibbs!, stylized with emphasis (an underline) on "Mister", is a 1970 DeLuxe Color film. The second installment in a trilogy, the release was preceded by In the Heat of the Night (1967) and followed by The Organization (1971). The movie title was taken from a line in the first film.
Sidney Poitier reprised his role of police detective Virgil Tibbs, though in this sequel, Tibbs is working for the San Francisco Police rather than the Philadelphia Police (as in the original film) or the Pasadena Police (as in the novels).
