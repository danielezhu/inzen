Hergest Ridge is the second record album by Mike Oldfield, released in 1974 on Virgin Records. The album was reissued with bonus material and new artwork in June 2010.
During 1973, Oldfield was uncomfortable with the public attention that he had received from the success of Tubular Bells, and retreated to the English countryside to work on his follow-up. The result was Hergest Ridge, named for the hill near Kington, Herefordshire on the border between England and Wales, and near where he was living at the time.
Hergest Ridge entered the UK album charts at number one, only to be displaced by its predecessor, Tubular Bells. Oldfield is thus one of only a few artists (among whom are The Beatles and Bob Dylan) to have defeated themselves in this manner.
