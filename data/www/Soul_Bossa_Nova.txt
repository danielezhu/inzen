"Soul Bossa Nova" is a popular instrumental title, composed by and first performed by American impresario, jazz composer, arranger, and record producer Quincy Jones. It appeared on his 1962 Big Band Bossa Nova album on Mercury Records.
According to Jones, he took twenty minutes to compose the piece. The piece prominently features a cu√≠ca, responsible for the distinctive "laughing" sound in the first bars. Multi-reed player Roland Kirk played the flute solo. Incomplete personnel on the album liner notes do not specify the prominent brass players.
