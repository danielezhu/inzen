The World's Billionaires is an annual ranking of the world's wealthiest billionaires compiled and published every March by the American business magazine Forbes. The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated, in United States dollars, based on their assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.
The list has been published annually in March since 1987. As of 2017, Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 23 years. In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers with 76 from China and 25 from the United States; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women. The average net worth of the list came in at US$3.75 billion, down US$110 million from 2015. Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67 trillion, up from US$7.1 trillion in 2015. According to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as "half the human race".
