Scientific pitch notation (or SPN, also known as American Standard Pitch Notation (ASPN) and International Pitch Notation (IPN)) is a method of specifying musical pitch by combining a musical note name (with accidental if needed) and a number identifying the pitch's octave.
Although scientific pitch notation (SPN) was originally designed as a companion to "scientific pitch" (see below), the two are not synonymous, and should not be confused. Scientific pitch is a pitch standardâ€”a system which defines the specific frequencies of particular pitches (see below). SPN concerns only how pitch names are notated, that is, how they are designated in printed and written text, and does not inherently specify actual frequencies. Thus the use of SPN to distinguish octaves does not depend on the pitch standard used.
