Four in One (subtitled A Tribute to Thelonious Monk) is the debut album by the group Sphere featuring saxophonist Charlie Rouse, pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Buster Williams, and Monk's former drummer Ben Riley which was recorded in early 1982 and released on the Elektra/Musician label. The album was recorded on the day of Monk's death but before the musicians had heard of it.
