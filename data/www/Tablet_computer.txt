A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile computer with a touchscreen display, which is usually in color, processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single thin, flat package. Most tablets also have sensors, including digital cameras, a microphone, and an accelerometer so images on screens are always displayed upright. The touchscreen display uses gestures by finger or stylus to replace the mouse, trackpad and keyboard used with desktop computers and laptops.
Tablets are larger than smartphones or personal digital assistants with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally. However, much of a tablet's functionality resembles that of a modern smartphone, using a virtual keyboard and running a mobile operating system.
Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and physical appearance of keyboards. Slates and booklets do not have a physical keyboard, and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on a touchscreen-enabled display. Hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s all have physical keyboards (although these are usually concealable or detachable), yet they typically also make use of virtual keyboards. Some 2-in-1s have processors and operating systems like a full laptop, whilst having the flexibility of being used as a tablet. Most tablets can use separate keyboards connected using Bluetooth.
The format was conceptualized in the mid-20th century (Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey) and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century. In April 2010, Apple released the iPad, the first mass-market tablet to achieve widespread popularity. Thereafter in the 2010s, tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and became a large product category used for both personal and workplace applications.
