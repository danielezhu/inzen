Harvard Stadium is a U-shaped football stadium in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, in the United States. Built in 1903, it was a pioneering execution of reinforced concrete in the construction of large structures. Because of its early importance in these areas, and its influence on the design of later stadiums, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The Stadium is owned and operated by Harvard University and is home to the Harvard Crimson football program. It was also home for the New England Patriots in the 1970 season, their first after the AFLâ€“NFL merger, before the completion of Foxboro Stadium.
The stadium seats 30,323. The stadium seated up to 57,166 in the past, as permanent steel stands (completing a straight-sided oval) were installed in the north end of the stadium in 1929. They were torn down after the 1951 season due to deterioration and reduced attendance. Afterwards, there were smaller temporary steel bleachers across the open end of the stadium until the building of the Murr Center (which is topped by the new scoreboard) in 1998.
