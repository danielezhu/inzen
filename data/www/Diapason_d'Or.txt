The Diapason d'Or is a recommendation of outstanding (mostly) classical music recordings given by reviewers of Diapason magazine in France, broadly equivalent to "Editor's Choice", "Disc of the Month" in the British Gramophone magazine.
The Diapason d'Or de l’Année is a more prestigious award, decided by a jury comprising critics from Diapason and broadcasters from France Musique, and is comparable to the United Kingdom's (UK) Gramophone Awards, associated with the Gramophone magazine.
