DeVry University (/dəˈvraɪ/) is an American for-profit college. The school was founded in 1931 as DeForest Training School, and officially became DeVry University in 2002.
The university is a division of DeVry Education Group, a company that is also the parent organization for Keller Graduate School of Management, Ross University School of Medicine, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, American University of the Caribbean, Carrington College, Chamberlain College of Nursing, Becker Professional Review, and DeVry Brasil. DeVry Education Group is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, and Lisa Wardell is the company's CEO. DeVry University is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.
As of early 2017, DeVry had total enrollment of 45,633 at more than 55 campuses throughout North America.
DeVry has faced increasing scrutiny and criticism from a variety of sources, including the United States government, state attorneys general in Illinois and Massachusetts, the Pew Foundation, and the Mississippi Center for Justice (representing former students). Allegations have included that DeVry used deceptive recruiting tactics, mislead students about their career prospects, and distorted data to bypass Federal regulations.
