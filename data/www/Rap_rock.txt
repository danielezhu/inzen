Rap rock is a music genre that fuses vocal and instrumental elements of hip hop with various forms of rock. Rap rock's most popular subgenres include rap metal and rapcore, which include heavy metal and hardcore punk-oriented influences, respectively. One of the earliest examples would be "The Magnificent Seven" by The Clash, which fused new wave, hip hop, and funk.
