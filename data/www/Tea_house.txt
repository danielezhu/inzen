A tea house is an establishment which primarily serves tea and other light refreshments. Sometimes the word "tea" is also used to refer to a meal￼￼. Although the functions of tea houses vary widely in different countries, tea houses often serve as centers of social interaction, like coffeehouses.
Some cultures have a variety of distinct tea-centered houses of different types, depending on the national tea culture. For example, the British or American tearoom serves afternoon tea with a variety of small cakes.
