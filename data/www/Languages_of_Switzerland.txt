The four national languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian and Romansh. All but Romansh maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the Federal Administration of the Swiss Confederation.
In 2013, native speakers of German (chiefly Swiss German, though Standard German is also understood) number about 5 million (63.5%); French (mostly Swiss French, but including some Arpitan dialects) number 1.8 million (22.5%); Italian (mostly Swiss Italian, but including Lombard dialects), 645,000 (8.1%); and Romansh, 40,000 (0.5%).
The German region (Deutschschweiz) is roughly in the east, north and center; the French part (la Romandie) in the west and the Italian area (Svizzera italiana) in the south. There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in Graubünden in the east. The cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Valais are officially bilingual; Graubünden is officially trilingual.
