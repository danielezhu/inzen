The Magic Touch is a 1962 album by jazz pianist and arranger Tadd Dameron and His Orchestra, released on Riverside Records.
The Allmusic Review of the line-up says that "one has to be in awe of them, and that only Dameron was able to convene such a band of extraordinary jazz performers in their prime."
The album has since been reissued many times on Original Jazz Classics, most recently in 2008.
