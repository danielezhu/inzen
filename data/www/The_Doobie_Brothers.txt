The Doobie Brothers are an American rock band from San Jose, California. The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide throughout its career. The band has been active for five decades, with their biggest success occurring in the 1970s.
The band's history can be roughly divided into three eras. From 1969 to 1975 they featured lead vocalist Tom Johnston and featured a mainstream rock and roll sound with elements of folk, country and R&B. Johnston quit the group in 1975, and was replaced with Michael McDonald whose interest in soul music changed the sound of the band until they broke up in 1982. The Doobie Brothers reformed in 1987 with Johnston back in the fold and are active to the present with occasional contributions from McDonald. Every incarnation of the group emphasized vocal harmonies from the band's members. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.
