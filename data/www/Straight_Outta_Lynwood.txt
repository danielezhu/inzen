Straight Outta Lynwood is the twelfth studio album by "Weird Al" Yankovic, released on September 26, 2006. It was the sixth studio album self-produced by Yankovic. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-2000s. The album's lead single, "White & Nerdy", is a parody of Chamillionaire's hit single "Ridin'". The single peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100; "Canadian Idiot" also charted, peaking at number 82.
The album featured five parodies. Aside from the aforementioned "White & Nerdy" and "Canadian Idiot", the album also contains lampoons of "Confessions Part II" by Usher, "Do I Make You Proud" by Taylor Hicks, and "Trapped in the Closet" by R. Kelly. The other half of the album is original material, featuring many "style parodies", or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Brian Wilson, Rage Against the Machine, Sparks, animated musical specials, Cake, and 1980s charity songs. Originally, there were plans for the album's lead single to have been a spoof of James Blunt's hit "You're Beautiful" entitled "You're Pitiful", but Blunt's record label, Atlantic, blocked the commercial release of the parody.
The CD release was a DualDisc; one side of the disc played the album, and the other side functioned as a DVD, featuring animated music videos for many of the songs on the record. Straight Outta Lynwood was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics praising "White & Nerdy" and "Trapped in the Drive-Thru". Some of the other parody songs, however, were met with a more mixed response. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200. "White & Nerdy" became Yankovic's highest-charting single, as well as his first Platinum-certified single. The record itself was certified Gold for shipments of over 500,000 copies.
