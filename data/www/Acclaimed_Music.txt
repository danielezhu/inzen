Acclaimed Music is a website created by Henrik Franzon, a statistician from Stockholm, Sweden in September, 2001. Franzon has statistically aggregated hundreds of published lists that rank songs and albums into aggregated rankings by year, decade and all-time. Lists that are submitted by readers to magazines or websites are excluded from the aggregation. Author Michaelangelo Matos writes that "Franzon's methods are imperfect, but as indicators of overall critical appeal go, it's hard to beat."
According to the site's most recently updated aggregated lists, Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys is the most highly rated album of all time, and "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan is the most highly rated song of all time. According to the site The Beatles is the most acclaimed band, Bob Dylan is the most acclaimed male artist, and Madonna is the most acclaimed female artist.
