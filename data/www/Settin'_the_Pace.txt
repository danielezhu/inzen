Settin' the Pace is an album credited to jazz musician John Coltrane, released in 1961 on Prestige Records, catalogue 7213. It is assembled from unissued results of a single recording session at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey in 1958. Coltrane on tenor saxophone is accompanied by the Red Garland Trio with Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. With Garland and Chambers Coltrane had played together since at least October 1955 in Miles Davis' band. With Art Taylor they were part of the Tenor Conclave recordings in September 1956. As a quartet they had already recorded two albums for Prestige, John Coltrane with the Red Garland Trio and Soultrane. The material the quartet recorded on this session were extended interpretations of three popular songs not played by jazz musicians before, and "Little Melonae", a classic bebop tune written by Jackie McLean.
