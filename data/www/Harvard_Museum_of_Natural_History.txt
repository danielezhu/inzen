The Harvard Museum of Natural History is a natural history museum on the grounds of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It displays a sampling of specimens drawn from the collections of the University's three natural history research museums:
the Harvard University Herbaria
the Museum of Comparative Zoology
the Harvard Mineralogical Museum.
The museum is physically connected to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and one admission grants visitors access to both museums. In December 2012, Harvard announced a new consortium, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, whose members are the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Semitic Museum, the Peabody Museum, and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments.
