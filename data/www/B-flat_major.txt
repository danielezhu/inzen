In music theory, B-flat major is a major scale based on B♭. The pitches B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G, and A are all part of the B-flat major scale. Its key signature has two flats.
B♭ major's relative minor is G minor, and its parallel minor is B♭ minor.
Many transposing instruments are pitched in B-flat major, including the clarinet, trumpet, tenor saxophone, and soprano saxophone. As a result, B-flat major is a popular key for concert band compositions.

In Nordic, Baltic, Western and Southern Slavic (except Bulgarian) languages, Hungarian, German and most Central and Northern European languages, the pitch B is called "H" while B-flat is called "B".
