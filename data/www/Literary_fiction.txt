Literary fiction are fictional works that are deemed to be of literary merit, as distinguished from most commercial, or "genre" fiction. The distinction can be controversial among critics and scholars, especially because a number of major literary figures have written genre fiction, including John Banville, Doris Lessing, Iain Banks, and Margaret Atwood.
