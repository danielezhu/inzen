Jonathan Edwards College (informally JE) is a residential college at Yale University. It is named for theologian and minister Jonathan Edwards, a 1720 graduate of Yale College. Opened to undergraduates in 1933, JE is one of the original eight residential colleges donated by Edward Harkness. It also among the smallest of Yale's residential colleges, by both footprint and undergraduate membership.
JE's residential quadrangle was the first to be completed in Yale's residential college system. Because its design employed buildings finished before the Residential College Plan was adopted, it is stylistically eclectic, but predominantly in the Collegiate Gothic style popularized at Yale by the Memorial Quadrangle.
