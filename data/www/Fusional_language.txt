Fusional languages or inflected languages are a type of synthetic languages, distinguished from agglutinative languages by their tendency to use a single morpheme in combination with affixes to denote multiple grammatical, syntactic, or semantic changes. For example, the Spanish language verb comer ("to eat") can be expressed in first-person past preterite tense as comí, a word formed removing the "-er" suffix of the verb and replacing it by "-í", that indicate such specific meaning.
Examples of fusional Indo-European languages are: Sanskrit, Pashto, Punjabi, Hindustani, Greek (classical and modern), Latin, Italian, French and the Iberian Romance dialect continuum, Irish, Lithuanian, Latvian, German, Faroese, Icelandic, Russian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Albanian and many Caucasian languages. Another notable group of fusional languages is the Semitic languages group; however, modern Aramaic and Hebrew are much more analytic than their classic versions, as are colloquial varieties of Arabic than the standard language, having lost all noun declensions, and in many cases also featuring simplified conjugation. A high degree of fusion is also found in many Finno-Ugric, Uralic and Samoyedic languages, like Hungarian, Estonian, Finnish and the Sami languages, such as Skolt Sami. Unusually for a natively North American language, Navajo is sometimes described as fusional due to its complex and inseparable verb morphology.
An illustration of fusionality is the Latin word bonus ("good"). The ending -us denotes masculine gender, nominative case, and singular number. Changing any one of these features requires replacing the suffix -us with a different one. In the form bonum, the ending -um denotes masculine accusative singular, neuter accusative singular, or neuter nominative singular.
