It can be found used in various financial documents including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts.
It was the name of a British government department originating in the Anglo-Saxon period of England and responsible for the collection and the management of taxes and revenues; of making payments on behalf of the sovereign and auditing official accounts. It also developed a judicial role along with its accountancy responsibilities and tried legal cases relating to revenue.
