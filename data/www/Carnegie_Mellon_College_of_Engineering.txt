The Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering is the academic unit
that manages engineering research and education at Carnegie Mellon. The
College can trace its origins from Andrew Carnegie's founding of the Carnegie
Technical Schools. Today, The College of Engineering has seven departments of
study and is ranked 5th nationally.[1]

## History[edit]

By 1905, the massive buildings of the Carnegie Technical Schools were being
constructed in a field east of the University of Pittsburgh. The first
students of the School of Science and Technology began classes in unfinished
buildings, still surrounded by new construction. The school initially offered
two- and three-year programs to train the children of Pittsburgh's working
class. After the merger between Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research, the newly formed Carnegie Mellon University's College of
Engineering and Science was divided into the Carnegie Institute of Technology
(engineering) and the Mellon College of Science. Subsequently, the Carnegie
Institute of Technology was re-branded as the College of Engineering.

The Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering has led the way in many engineering
fields and trends. In 1971, with the help from the Heinz College, the College
established one of the first departments in Engineering and Public Policy to
educate engineers in social and policy issues while performing research in
science and technology policy. In 1989, the College established the nation’s
first institute devoted to information networking, the Information Networking
Institute.[2]

## About the College of Engineering[edit]

There are approximately 1,785 full-time undergraduate, 1,254 master’s, and 670
doctoral students enrolled at the College. The college employs 207 faculty
members whose research is recognized and supported by such sources as the
National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency.[3]
As part of Carnegie Mellon University, the College of Engineering works to
carry out the university’s mission of “changing the needs of society by
building on its traditions of innovation, problem-solving and
interdisciplinarity”.[4] Students in the College of Engineering have the
advantage of working with experts in their own field of study, as well as with
students and faculty across the other engineering departments and academic
colleges. Because of the college’s small size and focus on interdisciplinary
collaboration, students graduate with a high-quality education that extends
far beyond their expert technical knowledge, ensuring they have the problem-
solving skills needed to be successful in a diverse collection of individual
careers.[5] The College's Office of the Dean is housed in Scaife Hall, and the
college's primary facilities include Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Engineering
Hall, Doherty Hall, and Scott Hall, in addition to Scaife.

## Academics[edit]
