The A-flat major scale (A♭ major scale) consists of the pitches A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, and G. Its key signature has four flats.
Its relative minor is F minor. Its parallel minor, A♭ minor, is usually replaced by G♯ minor, since A♭ minor, which would contain seven flats, is not normally used. G♯ major, with eight sharps, including the F, has a similar problem, and so A♭ major is often used as the parallel major for G♯ minor. The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of D♭ major and C♯ minor, with C♯ major having seven sharps and D♭ minor having eight flats, including the B.
It was used quite often by Franz Schubert; twenty-four of Frédéric Chopin's piano pieces are in A-flat major, more than any other key.
