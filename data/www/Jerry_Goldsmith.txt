Jerrald King "Jerry" Goldsmith (February 10, 1929 â€“ July 21, 2004) was an American composer and conductor most known for his work in film and television scoring. He composed scores for such noteworthy films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Sand Pebbles, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Patton, Papillon, Chinatown, The Wind and the Lion, The Omen, The Boys from Brazil, Capricorn One, Alien, Outland, Poltergeist, The Secret of NIMH, Gremlins, Hoosiers, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Rudy, Air Force One, L.A. Confidential, Mulan, The Mummy, three Rambo films, Explorers and four other Star Trek films.
He collaborated with some of film history's most accomplished directors, including Robert Wise, Howard Hawks, Otto Preminger, Joe Dante, Richard Donner, Roman Polanski, Ridley Scott, Michael Winner, Steven Spielberg, Paul Verhoeven, and Franklin J. Schaffner. Unfortunately his work for Richard Donner and Ridley Scott also sadly involved a rejected score for "Timeline (film) and a cut and paste score for Alien, where music by Howard Hanson replaced Goldsmith's music in some scenes. In what could be seen as a token gesture by Ridley Scott, Goldsmith's original theme was given an important part in Alien: Covenant.
Goldsmith was nominated for six Grammy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy Film Awards, and eighteen Academy Awards (he won only one, in 1976, for The Omen).
