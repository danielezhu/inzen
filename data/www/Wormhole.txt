A wormhole is a solution of the Einstein field equations having a non-trivial structure linking separate points in spacetime, much like a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime. Such connections are consistent with the General Theory of Relativity, yet their existence remains hypothetical.
A wormhole may connect extremely long distances such as a billion light years or more; short distances such as a few meters; different universes; and/or different points in time.
