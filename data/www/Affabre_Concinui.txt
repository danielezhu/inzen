Affabre Concinui, also known as Affabre – The Chamber Singers, are a Polish a cappella vocal ensemble (sextet) founded in 1983 by alumni of two famous Polish choirs: Poznań Boys' Choir and Poznań Nightingales, inspired by the British ensemble The King's Singers. The name of the ensemble (Affabre Concinui) means in Latin "perfectly attuned" or "ideally harmonized", which is an artistic credo of the group. They quickly gained renown in Poland and many other countries.
