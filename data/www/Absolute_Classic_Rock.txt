Absolute Classic Rock is a radio station part of the Absolute Radio network, broadcasting to London via DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and worldwide on the internet.
Formerly known as Virgin Radio Classic Rock, it originally was an internet-only radio station, and launched in 2000 under the name Virgin Classic by Lee Roberts, SMG Radio Director. On DAB Digital Radio in London, the station launched at 12:15pm with Richard Skinner introducing Steppenwolf's Born to Be Wild. The launch time, presenter, and song (though not the artist) were identical to its parent station Virgin Radio.
On 1 September 2008 it was announced that Virgin Radio Classic Rock would be rebranded as Absolute Classic Rock on 29 September 2008.
The station was removed from Freesat channel 725 on 8 December 2011 because of "economic realities".
