Yahoo Sports is a sports news website launched by Yahoo! on December 8, 1997. It receives a majority of its information from STATS, Inc. It employs numerous writers, and has team pages for teams in almost every North American sport. Before the launch of Yahoo Sports, certain elements of the site were known as Yahoo! Scoreboard.
From 2011 to 2016, the Yahoo Sports brand had also been used for a U.S. sports radio network. That network is now known as SB Nation Radio.
