Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. "Serious" or "cultivated" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called "vernacular music"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: "serious music" and "light music".
