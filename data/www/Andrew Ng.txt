In addition, he is an adjunct professor (formerly associate professor) at Stanford University. Ng is also the co-founder and chairman of Coursera, an online education platform.
Ng researches primarily in machine learning and deep learning. His early work includes the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter project, which developed one of the most capable autonomous helicopters in the world, and the STAIR (STanford Artificial Intelligence Robot) project, which resulted in ROS, a widely used open-source robotics software platform.
Ng is also the author or co-author of over 100 published papers in machine learning, robotics, and related fields, and some of his work in computer vision has been featured in press releases and reviews. In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2007, Ng was awarded a Sloan Fellowship. For his work in artificial intelligence, he is also a recipient of the Computers and Thought Award (2009).
On May 16, 2014, Ng announced from his Coursera blog that he would be stepping away from his day-to-day responsibilities at Coursera, and join Baidu as chief scientist, working on deep learning.
