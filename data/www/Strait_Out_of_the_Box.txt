Strait Out of the Box is the first box set album by American country music artist George Strait. It contains four albums worth of music, dating from 1976 to 1995. It mainly consists of Strait's singles, except for a select few that Strait decided to exclude. They were replaced by Strait's choice of album cuts and several studio outtakes. It also contains Strait's three singles recorded in the 1970s for indie label D Records, one of which, "I Just Can't Go on Dying Like This", was re-recorded for Strait's 2013 album Love Is Everything.
"Check Yes or No" and "I Know She Still Loves Me" were both released from this set as singles. Respectively, they reached number 1 and number 5 on the Billboard country charts.
As of 2006, it was the best-selling country music box set of all time, selling more than two million copies, and is second only to the Live 1975â€“85 box set by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in sales.
