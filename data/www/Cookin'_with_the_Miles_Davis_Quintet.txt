Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet is an album recorded in 1956 by the Miles Davis in Rudy Van Gelder studio in Hackensack, New Jersey. It is the first official release of his so-called First Great Quintet to fulfill his contract with the Prestige label. As the musicians had to pay for the studio time (a result of a rather modest contract with Prestige), their recordings are practically live. Two sessions 11 May 1956 and 26 October in the same year resulted in four albums—this one, Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet and Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet.
It was the first of the four LPs to be released. In response to the album title, Davis said, "After all, that's what we did—came in and cooked".
The album was originally released on CD in the U.S. in 1987, and it was remastered for CD most recently by Rudy Van Gelder again in 2006 for Prestige Records.
