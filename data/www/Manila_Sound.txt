Manila Sound is a musical genre in the Philippines that began in the early 1970s in Manila, flourished and peaked in the mid to late 1970s, and waned in popularity by the early 1980s. It is often considered the "bright side" of the Martial Law era and has influenced all modern genres in the country by being the forerunner to OPM.
