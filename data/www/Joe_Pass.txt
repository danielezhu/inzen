Joe Pass (born Joseph Anthony Jacobi Passalaqua; January 13, 1929 â€“ May 23, 1994) was an American virtuoso jazz guitarist of Sicilian descent. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the 20th century. His sophisticated style of chord-melody, with an outstanding knowledge of chord inversions and progressions, extensive use of walking basslines, and melodic counterpoint during improvisation, opened up new possibilities for the jazz guitar and had a profound influence on later guitarists.
In addition to his extensive solo work, Pass is remembered for his long-term partnerships with singer Ella Fitzgerald and pianist Oscar Peterson.
