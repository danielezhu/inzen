Concord Records is an American record label based in Beverly Hills, California. Originally known as Concord Jazz, it was established in 1972 as an offshoot of the Concord Jazz Festival in Concord, California, by festival founder Carl Jefferson, a local automobile dealer and jazz fan who sold his dealership to found "the jazz label I can never find in record stores." The label's artists have won 14 Grammy Awards and 88 Grammy nominations.
Concord issues live recordings from festivals and other venues, including a series of piano recitals from Maybeck Recital Hall in Berkeley, California, by many well-known pianists. The original Concord Jazz logo, a stylized eighth note incorporating the C and J of "Concord Jazz", was created by Bay Area graphic designer Dan Buck, who also worked on several album covers for the company.
Concord's label's included Concord Picante for Latin jazz and Concord Concerto for classical music. Concord also includes The Jazz Alliance, founded around 1990 to issue programs from Marian McPartland's radio broadcast Piano Jazz.
