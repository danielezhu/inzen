This is a list of the absolute frequencies in hertz (cycles per second) of the keys of a modern 88-key standard or 102-key extended piano in twelve-tone equal temperament, with the 49th key, the fifth A (called A4), tuned to 440 Hz (referred to as A440). Each successive pitch is derived by multiplying (ascending) or dividing (descending) the previous by the twelfth root of two (approximately 1.05946). For example, to get the frequency a semitone up from A4 (A♯4), multiply 440 by the twelfth root of two. To go from A4 to B4 (up a whole tone, or two semitones), multiply 440 twice by the twelfth root of two (or just by the sixth root of two, approximately 1.12246). For other tuning schemes refer to musical tuning.
This list of frequencies is for a theoretically ideal piano. On an actual piano the ratio between semitones is slightly larger, especially at the high and low ends, where string stiffness causes inharmonicity, i.e., the tendency for the harmonic makeup of each note to run sharp. To compensate for this, octaves are tuned slightly wide, stretched according to the inharmonic characteristics of each instrument. This deviation from equal temperament is called the Railsback curve.
The following equation gives the frequency f of the nth key, as shown in the table:

  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        =
        
          
            (
            
              
                2
                
                  12
                
              
            
            
            )
          
          
            n
            −
            49

        440
        
        
          Hz
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)=\left({\sqrt[{12}]{2}}\,\right)^{n-49}\times 440\,{\text{Hz}}\,}
  
(a' = A4 = A440 is the 49th key on the idealized standard piano)
Alternatively, this can be written as:

  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        =
        
          2
          
            
              
                n
                −
                49
              
              12
            
          
        
        ×
        440
        
        
          Hz
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)=2^{\frac {n-49}{12}}\times 440\,{\text{Hz}}\,}
  
Conversely, starting from a frequency on the idealized standard piano tuned to A440, one obtains the key number by:

  
    
      
        n
        =
        12
        
        
          log
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            
              f
              
                440
                
                
                  Hz
                
              
            
          
          )
        
        +
        49
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=12\,\log _{2}\left({\frac {f}{440\,{\text{Hz}}}}\right)+49}
