APC (formerly known as Australian Personal Computer) is a computer magazine in Australia. It is published monthly and comes with a cover-mounted DVD of software. The magazine was bought from Bauer Media Group in 2013 by Future plc.
According to the current editor, Tony Sarno, APC remains the personal computing magazine of choice for IT professionals and "power-users" (APC, June 2004, P10). The tagline on the front of the magazine is "high performance personal computing" which APC uses as its point of distinction from other computing titles published in Australia, such as PC User which targets beginner-medium users, and Atomic which targets gamers/modders.
APC was first published in May 1980 by Sean Howard and is the longest running computer-magazine in Australia.
The magazine also has a website, which publishes daily technology news (separate to what's in the printed magazine, with very few exceptions).
