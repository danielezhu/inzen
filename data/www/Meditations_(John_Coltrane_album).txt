Meditations is a 1966 album by John Coltrane. The album was considered the "spiritual follow-up to A Love Supreme." It features Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders as soloists, both playing tenor saxophones. Much of the recording is avant-garde, featuring extensive passages in free rhythm and extended saxophone techniques such as honked and overblown notes, as well as multiphonics. This would be the last Coltrane recording with long-time partners drummer Elvin Jones and pianist McCoy Tyner.
Alternative versions of tracks 2â€“5, later issued as First Meditations (for quartet), not issued until 12 years later in 1977, had been recorded in September 1965 by the same musicians minus Rashied Ali and Sanders, and were more restrained, containing fewer overblown notes.
