Live at Birdland is a 1964 album by jazz musician John Coltrane. Despite its title, only the first three tracks were recorded live at the Birdland club; the rest are studio tracks. Among them is "Alabama", a tribute to four children killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, an attack at a Birmingham, Alabama church by white supremacists. The album's original pressing accidentally included a false start - this was corrected in later copies, but restored in CD editions. The album also features a live recording of "I Want to Talk About You", a song Coltrane had recorded on his 1958 album Soultrane, this time with an extended cadenza.
