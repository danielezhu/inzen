Pitch accent (tone accent) is a feature of certain languages whose variations in pitch (linguistic tones) can be used to differentiate words, but the potentially distinctive tones are restricted to one or two syllables within a word. This contrasts with fully-tonal languages like Standard Chinese in which each syllable can have an independent tone. In a pitch accent language, the syllable with phonemic tone is typically acoustically prominent (stressed). Also, many words may not be marked for tone at all.
Languages that have been described as pitch accent languages include certain Scandinavian and South Slavic languages, Baltic languages, Ancient Greek, Vedic Sanskrit, Japanese, Korean, Yaqui and Shanghainese.
It has been claimed that the term "pitch accent" is not coherently defined. Indeed, it is also used to denote a different feature, namely the use or relatively strong use of pitch, as opposed to other cues like acoustic intensity, to give prominence (accent) to a syllable or mora within a word. The latter feature is dealt with in the article pitch accent (intonation).
