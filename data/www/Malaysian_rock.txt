Malaysian underground music and idealism is popular locally and overseas. Malaysian youth are typically into the punk culture (including hardcore and its other subgenre). This reflect in the music that they write (band/musician). Most of the Malaysian rock music scene started in Terengganu which has a thriving punk/hardcore scene.
