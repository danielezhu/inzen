Area code 425 is a telephone dialing code in Washington for the suburbs north and east of Seattle, particularly the Eastside, extending east to North Bend, north to Everett, and south to Maple Valley. It includes the city of Bellevue, Seattle's largest suburb.
The area code went into service on April 27, 1997, as part of a three-way split of area code 206 (the other of the three is 253). The period from April 27, 1997, through November 15, 1997, was considered a "transition period" for this new area code. Use of the 425 area code became mandatory on Sunday, November 16, 1997.
