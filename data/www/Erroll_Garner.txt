Erroll Louis Garner (June 15, 1923 â€“ January 2, 1977; some sources say 1921) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition, the ballad "Misty", has become a jazz standard. Scott Yanow of Allmusic calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".
He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6363 Hollywood Blvd.
