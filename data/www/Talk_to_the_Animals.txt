For the Australian TV series see, Talk to the Animals (TV series).
"Talk to the Animals" is a song written by British composer Leslie Bricusse.
Written for the film Doctor Dolittle, it won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 40th Academy Awards. It was performed in the film by Rex Harrison. The song was not generally well appreciated, and in some cases was disliked, by those who were working on the film during the time of its production. However, it has since become the signature song of the character as evidenced by it being sung in the 1998 remake of the film starring Eddie Murphy.
