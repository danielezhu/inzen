Oakland is officially divided into four neighborhoods: **North Oakland** ,
**West Oakland** , **Central Oakland** , and **South Oakland**. Each section
has a unique identity, and offers its own flavor of venues and housing.
Oakland is Pittsburgh's second most populated neighborhood with 22,210
residents, a majority of these residents being students.

###  North Oakland[edit]

**North Oakland** can be loosely defined as the area of Oakland between
Neville and Bouquet Streets, encompassing all of Craig Street and running
north to Polish Hill. The Cathedral of Learning, the engineering or midsection
of the University of Pittsburgh campus, and the Craig Street business district
are in North Oakland.

RAND's Pittsburgh center is located in North Oakland as well as the long time
RIDC business incubator on Henry Street.[2] North Oakland is also home to the
Schenley Farms Historic District and many mid-rise condominium and apartment
buildings.

###  Central Oakland[edit]

**Central Oakland** is bordered by Schenley Park, the Boulevard of the Allies,
Fifth Avenue, and Halket Street. Many students at the University of Pittsburgh
who decide to live off-campus reside in this neighborhood. Many of its homes
are historic masonry structures dating from the turn of the century. The area
is sometimes mistakenly called South Oakland. Its Main Business District runs
along Forbes and Fifth Avenue, and contains a diversity of restaurants,
retailers, and financial services. These businesses are organized by the
Oakland Business Improvement District (OBID). Smaller business districts in
Central Oakland provide additional dining options along Atwood Street and
Semple Street. It is also the location of the relatively isolated and historic
neighborhood of Panther Hollow which runs along Boundary Street in Junction
Hollow as well as the Oakland Square Historic District.

###  South Oakland[edit]

**South Oakland** runs along the Monongahela River and forms a triangular
shape between the Monongahela River, the Boulevard of the Allies, and the
western bank of Junction Hollow. Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC and the
Pittsburgh Technology Center are major landmarks of this neighborhood. The
neighborhood is split between a riverfront flood plain to the southwest and a
plateau to the northeast. The plateau is divided into two primarily
residential areas which are separated from one another by Bates Street, which
runs up a valley from the flood plain to the plateau. The residents of the
neighborhood on the north side of Bates Avenue call their neighborhood
Oakcliffe. The flood plain was previously packed with industrial sites such as
the Pittsburgh Works Consolidated Gas Co. and the Jones & Laughlin Steel
Co.,[3] but presently, the Pittsburgh Technology Center hosts facilities such
as the Entertainment Technology Center of Carnegie Mellon University.

Some residents of Central Oakland think of their neighborhood as being part of
South Oakland. However, the border between Central Oakland and South Oakland
is further south than they believe. The area between Forbes Avenue and
Boulevard of the Allies is officially part of Central Oakland. Articles in
some news media have made this error; for example, a column about street
cleanliness near the University of Pittsburgh used the term "South Oakland" to
describe an area entirely within the boundaries of Central Oakland.[4]

South Oakland is reputed to be a student neighborhood, but only 36.9% of its
population is between the ages of 18 and 24, compared to Central Oakland's
figure of 74.1%.[5] The difference is largely because the area between Forbes
Avenue and the Boulevard of the Allies houses many undergraduate students.
While it is commonly considered to be in South Oakland, it is actually the
heart of Central Oakland.

South Oakland was the childhood home of Andy Warhol, and later the residence
of fellow pop artist Keith Haring. Haring had his first art show while living
in Oakland. NFL Hall of Fame Quarterback Dan Marino was also born in Oakland,
not far from Warhol's home. Dan Marino Field on Frazier Street was named in
honor of its native son. Although they were not contemporaries, Warhol and
Marino grew up on the same block with their former houses only a few doors
apart.

### West Oakland[edit]

**West Oakland** , the smallest of the four districts, is bordered by Fifth
Avenue in the south, DeSoto Street in the east, the Birmingham Bridge to the
west, and Allequippa Street to the north. Carlow University and most of the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center can be found there.

### Not Oakland[edit]

Although the campus of Carnegie Mellon University and parts of Schenley Park,
including Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and Flagstaff Hill are
popularly referred to as being in Oakland, and are located with the 15213 zip
code, they are actually part of the adjacent neighborhood of Squirrel Hill
North. The border between Oakland and Squirrel Hill runs along Junction
Hollow.

## History[edit]

The name first appeared in 1839 in a local paper, _Harris' Intelligencer_. The
area got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William
Eichenbaum, who settled there in 1840. Oakland developed rapidly following the
Great Fire of 1845 in Downtown Pittsburgh, with many people moving out to
suburban territory. By 1860, there was considerable commercial development
along Fifth Avenue.

In 1868, Oakland Township was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh.[6] Twenty-one
years later, Mary Schenley gave the city 300 acres in Oakland for a park.
Officials bought another 100 acres from her for "Schenley Park." And Mary
Schenley gave another gift: land for Schenley Plaza. At Schenley Plaza,
industrialist Andrew Carnegie built a library, museum and concert hall
complex, which opened in 1895.

In 1917, Teddy Roosevelt visited the neighborhood.[7]

Oakland has long been considered Pittsburgh's university center. Carnegie
Mellon University is the result of a 1967 merger of the Carnegie Institute of
Technology, founded in Oakland in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie, and Mellon
Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon to conduct
industrial research. The University of Pittsburgh, which is heir to the
Pittsburgh Academy that was incorporated in 1787, relocated to Oakland in 1909
from its campus that was then in Allegheny.

Some of the most impressive architecture in Oakland is on Pitt's campus. In
1925, work began on what was then the world's tallest educational building,
the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Although the Cathedral of Learning is now
the fourth-tallest educationally purposed building in the world, it remains
the world's second tallest university building, the tallest educational
building in the Western Hemisphere,[8] and the second tallest gothic-styled
building in the world.[9] Oakland is also home to the university's French-
Gothic revival Heinz Memorial Chapel and St. Paul Cathedral, the seat of the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. It is also home of the main branch of
the Carnegie Library, the Carnegie Museum, and Phipps Conservatory.

Baseball fans might know Oakland for the beloved Forbes Field, which was built
in 1909 as the third home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and first home to the
Pittsburgh Steelers. While Forbes Field was closed in 1970, some remnants of
the ballpark still stand. Pirates fans gather on the site each year on the
anniversary of Bill Mazeroski's World Series winning home run on October 13,
1960.

The Decade nightclub was a staple of the neighborhood in the 1970s and
1980s.[10]

## Surrounding neighborhoods[edit]

North Oakland has eight borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of
Bloomfield to the northeast, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill North to the east,
Central Oakland to the south, West Oakland to the southwest, the Terrace
Village region of the Hill District to the west, the Upper Hill District to
the northwest Polish Hill to the north-northwest. North Oakland also runs
catty-corner (without a direct border) with Lower Lawrenceville to the north
with its meeting point in the middle of the Bloomfield Bridge.

South Oakland neighborhood

Central Oakland has five Pittsburgh neighborhood borders, including North
Oakland to the north, Squirrel Hill North to the northeast, Squirrel Hill
South to the east, South Oakland to the south and southwest, and West Oakland
to the northwest.

South Oakland has six land borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of
Central Oakland to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, Greenfield
to the southeast, Hazelwood to the south-southeast, Bluff to the west, and
West Oakland to the northwest. Across the Monongahela River, South Oakland
runs adjacent with Pittsburgh's South Side Flats neighborhood.

West Oakland has six borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North
Oakland to the northeast, Central Oakland to the southeast, South Oakland to
the south and south-southeast, Bluff to the southwest, and the Crawford-
Roberts and Terrace Village regions of the Hill District to the west and
northwest, respectively.

## Sites[edit]

  * The neighborhood is the location of the massive Carnegie culture complex, originally funded by Andrew Carnegie, which includes the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Music Hall.
  * Oakland is home to St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral, sponsor of the annual Greek Food Festival, as well as St. Paul Cathedral, mother church of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and the neighboring Pittsburgh Chinese Church.
  * Oakland's University of Pittsburgh Medical Center pioneered modern organ transplant surgery (home of Dr. Thomas Starzl). In 1955, the first effective polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
  * Oakland was, at various points, the home of many professional Pittsburgh sports team, including the hockey Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh Steelers and the baseball Pittsburgh Pirates. They played at now-defunct venues such as the Duquesne Gardens, Pitt Stadium, and Forbes Field.
  * The Pittsburgh Symphony and many touring plays and musical acts performed at the also now-defunct Syria Mosque. The Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera also called the neighborhood home, performing until 1961 at Pitt Stadium. The Pittsburgh Playhouse was founded in Oakland.
  * WQED, Pittsburgh's PBS station and the first community-sponsored television station in the United States, has been located in Oakland since 1954, although it moved from its original building to a new, larger one in 1970. WQED's first building, which had originally been the manse of a neighboring church, is now the Music Building of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus. _Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood_ , the nationally syndicated children's show, was taped at WQED's studios in Oakland.
  * WDTV-TV, now KDKA-TV, the region's first television station, went on the air at the Syria Mosque in Oakland on 11 January 1949. The event, aired on all four TV networks of the time DuMont, CBS, NBC, and ABC, was the first to "network" East Coast and Midwest TV stations into a modern "television network" of Pittsburgh and 13 other cities from Boston to St. Louis.
  * Oakland is less than 3 miles (4.8 km) from Downtown Pittsburgh, and as a whole is bordered by Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, the Hill District, Greenfield, Bloomfield, and Bluff.
