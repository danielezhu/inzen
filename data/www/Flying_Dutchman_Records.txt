Flying Dutchman Records was an American jazz record label, which was owned by veteran music industry executive, producer and songwriter Bob Thiele.
Initially distributed by Atlantic Records, Thiele made a five-album deal in 1972 with Mega Records to issue five albums in the Flying Dutchman Series. The deal was not renewed and distribution shifted to RCA Records, which took over the label in 1976.
Some of the musicians who recorded several albums for the label include singer Leon Thomas, saxophonist Gato Barbieri, arranger Oliver Nelson, saxophonist Tom Scott and pianist Lonnie Liston Smith. Gil Scott-Heron released three albums for the label, including his debut Small Talk at 125th and Lenox and Free Will.
Flying Dutchman had three sublabels, Amsterdam, BluesTime, and Contact.
Sony Music Entertainment now owns the Flying Dutchman catalog, which is distributed by its Legacy Recordings label.
