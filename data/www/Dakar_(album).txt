Dakar is an album credited to jazz musician John Coltrane, released in 1963 on Prestige Records, catalogue 7280. Dakar is a reissue of one side of a 16 rpm LP called Baritones and French Horns released in 1957, and originally credited to the "Prestige All Stars".
As Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s after he had stopped recording for Prestige, the record company assembled and reissued varied Coltrane recordings with his name prominently displayed, though in many cases, as on Dakar, he had originally been a sideman.
