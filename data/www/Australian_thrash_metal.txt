Australian thrash metal is a regional scene of thrash metal music that originated during the late 1980s.
While not considered a "major" part of the worldwide thrash metal scene due to distance from the major Bay Area and Teutonic scenes, Australian thrash metal has had a fairly substantial following in overseas markets, while local audiences have always been difficult to gather. Probably the most well-known Australian thrash bands from the 1980s would be Mortal Sin and Hobbs' Angel of Death.
