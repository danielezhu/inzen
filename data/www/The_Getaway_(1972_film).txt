The Getaway is a 1972 American neo-noir crime film directed by Sam Peckinpah. The screenplay by Walter Hill was based on the eponymous 1958 novel by Jim Thompson. Starring Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri, Sally Struthers, Jack Dodson, and Slim Pickens, the film tells the story of convicted robber Carter "Doc" McCoy (McQueen), who colludes with a corrupt politician Jack Beynon (Johnson) to be released from prison and later masterminds a bank heist organized by Beynon. A series of double-crosses ensues and Doc and his wife, Carol McCoy (MacGraw), attempt to flee from their pursuers to Mexico. The film marks the second collaboration between McQueen and Peckinpah after Junior Bonner, also released the same year.
Thompson was originally tapped by McQueen and producer David Foster to write the film adaptation of his book; he wrote the script in four months. However, due to creative differences, McQueen replaced him with Walter Hill; he wrote the script in six weeks. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair. McQueen and Peckinpah get involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah's longtime collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his workâ€”the only nomination the film has received.
The Getaway was released on December 13, 1972. A box office hit earning over $36 million in the United States alone, the film was one of the most financially successful productions of Peckinpah's and McQueen's careers. Critical reception for the film has been mixed upon release. It was remade in 1994, with Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger in the starring roles.
