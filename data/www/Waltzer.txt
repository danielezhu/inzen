A Waltzer is a flat fairground ride that often forms the centrepiece of traditional Scottish and English fairs. The ride consists of a number of cars which spin freely while rotating around a central point, in much the same way as a carousel. As the cars revolve, the floor of the ride undulates over a track so that the cars rise and fall gently as the ride spins. The offset weight of the riders causes each car to rotate. The riders experience varying levels of g-force from the spinning of the car, and the rotation of the ride itself. Because of this it is suitable for young people and adults â€“ operators will impose height and age restrictions.
