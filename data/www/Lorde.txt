Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), better known by her stage name Lorde (pronounced ), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and record producer. Born in Takapuna and raised in Devonport, Auckland, she became interested in performing as a child. In her early teens, she signed with Universal Music Group and was later paired with songwriter and record producer Joel Little. At the age of sixteen, she released her first extended play, The Love Club EP (2012), reaching number two on the national record charts in both New Zealand and Australia.
"Royals" was serviced as Lorde's debut single in mid-2013, becoming an international crossover hit and made her the youngest solo artist to achieve a US number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1987. Lorde's debut studio album Pure Heroine (2013) garnered positive reviews for her depiction of suburban adolescence; yielding the additional top-ten single "Team", it topped the national charts in New Zealand and Australia and reached number three on the US Billboard 200. The following year, Lorde curated the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€“ Part 1 (2014) and provided its lead single, "Yellow Flicker Beat". Lorde released her second studio album Melodrama (2017) after a three-year hiatus, launched with "Green Light" as its lead single. She served as executive producer alongside Jack Antonoff. The record dealt with themes of heartbreak and solitude.
Lorde's music consists of subgenres such as dream pop and indietronica. She has earned two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award and ten New Zealand Music Awards. In 2013, she was named among Time's most influential teenagers in the world, and in the following year, she was part of Forbes's "30 Under 30" list.
