The Love Movement is the fifth studio album by hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest. Musically, it followed in the same vein as Beats, Rhymes and Life, featuring the smooth, jazz-oriented beats of The Ummah. Critical reaction was mostly positive, for the album was a return to the original positive sound of their first three albums. The lead single, "Find a Way", secured major airplay on mainstream radio stations, even in the UK, and was a particularly good example of the relaxed vibe which defined the album. Although "Like It Like That" was issued on 12" as the second single, the album had no proper second video. However, many songs like "Steppin' It Up" were played on various radio stations. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album Gold on November 1, 1998.
Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote that the album's music was one "a fan could grow up with a bit rather than discarding after adolescence; it was sexual, wry and funny, coming with a range of expression that could include anger, satire, constructive preaching, and sentimentality; it was conscious of black entertainment's past."
