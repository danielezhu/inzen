The Believer is a jazz album credited to John Coltrane released in 1964 on Prestige Records, catalogue 7292. It is an amalgam of two tracks reissued from New Jazz Records 8228 The Ray Draper Quintet featuring John Coltrane released in 1960, with three unissued tracks by Coltrane as a leader from two separate recording sessions in 1958. All tracks were recorded at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey. As Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s long after he had stopped recording for the label, Prestige assembled varied recordings, often those where Coltrane had been merely a sideman, and reissued them as a new album with Coltrane's name prominently displayed.
