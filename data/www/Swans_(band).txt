Swans () are an American experimental rock band formed in 1982 by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Michael Gira. One of few acts to emerge from the New York City-based no wave scene and stay intact into the next decade, Swans have become legendary for an incomparable sound which has transformed throughout their career and contributed to the development of such genres as noise rock, post-punk, industrial and post-rock. Initially, their music was extremely harsh, incorporating more melody and intricacy following the 1986 addition of singer, songwriter and keyboardist Jarboe, who remained the band's only constant member except Gira and semi-constant guitarist Norman Westberg until their dissolution in 1997. Since 1990, all Swans records have been released through Gira's own label, Young God Records. In 2010, Gira re-formed the band without Jarboe, establishing a stable lineup of musicians which has released several albums to critical acclaim, touring worldwide. However, from 2017 following the tour in support of The Glowing Man, Gira will continue to record music under the Swans moniker "with a revolving cast of collaborators".
