The American Guild of Organists, or AGO, is a national organization of academic, church, and concert organists in the U.S., headquartered in The Interchurch Center in New York City. Founded as both an educational and service organization, it was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1896, with the authority to grant titles of associate or fellow to members who passed required examinations. Henry Houseley was a Founder of the American Guild of Organists, and Clifford Demarest played an important role in its first two decades. The Guild seeks to set and maintain high musical standards and to promote understanding and appreciation of all aspects of organ and choral music.
Membership is not limited to professional organists, but is open to anybody with an interest in the organ and organ music. There are approximately 25,000 AGO members in all categories, of whom 18,409 are voting members as of 2009. The AGO's current president is Michael Bedford, elected in 2016.
