"Wearing the Inside Out" is a song from Pink Floyd's 1994 album, The Division Bell. It is the first Pink Floyd song since "Time" from The Dark Side of the Moon where Richard Wright sings lead, as well as his final lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album. Additionally, it is the only song on the album for which David Gilmour receives no writing credit, and the only Pink Floyd song post-Dark Side to credit neither Roger Waters nor Gilmour. (Four instrumental tracks on The Endless River were however credited to Wright alone.)
The song had the working title "Evrika". Two videos of the band working on this demo version can be seen on the DVD/BD included in The Endless River deluxe edition and as part of the iTunes deluxe edition.
