The Official Lebanese Top 20 is the first weekly airplay chart in Lebanon, listing the most popular local and international hits across the country. The songs' popularity is solely determined by radio airplay frequency throughout a given week, audited and compiled by Ipsos SA. The Official Lebanese Top 20 was created by John Saad, an established Lebanese TV and radio personality. It is distributed through at least five media outlets ranging from TV stations to magazines and newspapers.
