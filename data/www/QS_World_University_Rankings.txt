_**QS World University Rankings**_ is an annual publication of university
rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Previously known as _Times Higher
Education–QS World University Rankings_ , the publisher had collaborated with
_Times Higher Education magazine_ ( _THE_ ) to publish its international
league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own
versions. QS then chose to still use the pre-existing methodology while _Times
Higher Education_ adopted a new methodology. The QS system now comprises the
global overall and subject rankings (which name the world's top universities
for the study of 46 different subjects and five composite faculty areas),
alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging
Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS).[1] It is the only
international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group
(IREG) approval,[2] and is viewed as one of the most widely read of its kind,
along with _Academic Ranking of World Universities_ and _Times Higher
Education World University Rankings_.[3][4][5][6] However, allocating undue
weight to subjective indicators and having highly fluctuating results are its
major criticisms.[7][8][9]

## History[edit]

A perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes
was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-
industry collaboration in Britain[10] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of
the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university
rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK to gauge the global standing of
its universities.

The idea for the rankings was credited in Ben Wildavsky's book, _The Great
Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World_ ,[11] to then-
editor of _Times Higher Education_ ( _THE_ ), John O'Leary. _THE_ chose to
partner with educational and careers advice company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
to supply the data, appointing Martin Ince,[12] formerly deputy editor and
later a contractor to _THE_ , to manage the project.

Between 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with _THE_. In
2009, _THE_ announced they would produce their own rankings, the Times Higher
Education World University Rankings, in partnership with Thomson Reuters.
_THE_ cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original
rankings,[13] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology
for science over the humanities,[14] as two of the key reasons for the
decision to split with QS.

QS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology
used to compile them[ _citation needed_ ] and continues to produce rankings
based on that methodology, which are now called the QS World University
Rankings.[15]

_THE_ created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first
Times Higher Education World University Rankings in September 2010.

QS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into
partnerships with a number of outlets, including The Guardian in the United
Kingdom, and Chosun Ilbo in Korea. The first rankings produced by QS
independently of THE, and using QS's consistent and original methodology, were
released on September 8, 2010, with the second appearing on September 6, 2011.

QS designed its rankings in order to assess performance according to what it
believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research,
nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]

**Academic peer review**

This is the most controversial part of the methodology[ _weasel  words_][
_citation needed_ ]. Using a combination of purchased mailing lists and
applications and suggestions, this survey asks active academicians across the
world about the top universities in their specialist fields. QS has published
the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants.[18]

The 2016/17 rankings made use of responses from 74,651 people from over 140
nations for its Academic Reputation indicator, including votes from the
previous five years rolled forward provided there was no more recent
information available from the same individual. Participants can nominate up
to 30 universities but are not able to vote for their own. They tend to
nominate a median of about 20, which means that this survey includes over
500,000 data points. The average respondent possesses 20.4 years of academic
experience, while 81% of respondents have over a decade of experience in the
academic world.[19][18]

In 2004, when the rankings first appeared, academic peer review accounted for
half of a university's possible score. In 2005, its share was cut to 40 per
cent because of the introduction of the Employer Reputation Survey.

**Faculty student ratio**

This indicator accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in
the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as a
proxy for teaching commitment, but QS has admitted that it is less than
satisfactory.[20]

**Citations per faculty**

Citations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to
national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used
citations data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since
then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of
citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a
university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20 per cent
of a university's possible score in the Rankings.

QS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per
paper preferred for other systems, because it reduces the effect of biomedical
science on the overall picture – bio-medicine has a ferocious "publish or
perish" culture. Instead QS attempts to measure the density of research-active
staff at each institution. But issues still remain about the use of citations
in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate
comparatively few citations.[21]

However, since 2015, QS have made methodological enhancements designed to
remove the advantage institutions specializing in the Natural Sciences or
Medicine previously received. This enhancement is termed faculty area
normalization, and ensures that an institution's citations count in each of
QS's five key Faculty Areas is weighted to account for 20% of the final
citations score.[22]

QS has conceded the presence of some data collection errors regarding
citations per faculty in previous years' rankings.[23]

One interesting issue is the difference between the Scopus and Thomson Reuters
databases. For major world universities, the two systems capture more or less
the same publications and citations. For less mainstream institutions, Scopus
has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its
database. But as the papers there are less heavily cited, this can also mean
fewer citations per paper for the universities that publish in them.[21] This
area has been criticized for undermining universities which do not use English
as their primary language.[24] Citations and publications in a language
different from English are harder to come across. The English language is the
most internationalized language and therefore is also the most popular when
citing.

**Employer review**

This part of the ranking is obtained by a similar method to the Academic Peer
Review, except that it samples recruiters who hire graduates on a global or
significant national scale. The numbers are smaller – 37,781 responses from
over 130 countries in the 2016 Rankings – and are used to produce 10 per cent
of any university's possible score. This survey was introduced in 2005 in the
belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of
teaching quality, a famously problematic thing to measure. University standing
here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was
the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published
in November 2015.[25][26]

**International orientation**

The final ten per cent of a university's possible score is derived from
measures intended to capture their internationalism: five percent from their
percentage of international students, and another five percent from their
percentage of international staff. This is of interest partly because it shows
whether a university is putting effort into being global, but also because it
tells us whether it is taken seriously enough by students and academics around
the world for them to want to be there.[27]

#### Reception[edit]

In September 2015, both The Guardian and The Daily Mail referred to the QS
World University Rankings as "the most authoritative of their
kind".[28][29][30] In 2016, Ben Sowter, Head of Research at the QS
Intelligence Unit, was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 'Higher
Education Power List'. The list enumerated what the organisation believed to
be the 50 most influential figures in UK higher education.[31]

Several universities in the UK and the Asia-Pacific region have commented on
the rankings positively. Vice-Chancellor of New Zealand's Massey University,
Professor Judith Kinnear, says that the Times Higher Education-QS ranking is a
"wonderful external acknowledgement of several university attributes,
including the quality of its research, research training, teaching and
employability." She said the rankings are a true measure of a university's
ability to fly high internationally: "The Times Higher Education ranking
provides a rather more and more sophisticated, robust and well rounded measure
of international and national ranking than either New Zealand's Performance
Based Research Fund (PBRF) measure or the Shanghai rankings."[32] In September
2012 the British newspaper _The Independent_ described the QS World University
Rankings as being "widely recognised throughout higher education as the most
trusted international tables".[33]

Angel Calderon, Principal Advisor for Planning and Research at RMIT University
and member of the QS Advisory Board, spoke positively of the QS University
Rankings for Latin America, saying that the "QS Latin American University
Rankings has become the annual international benchmark universities use to
ascertain their relative standing in the region". He further stated that the
2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.[34]

#### Criticisms[edit]

Certain commentators have expressed concern about the use or misuse of survey
data. However, QS's Intelligence Unit, responsible for compiling the rankings,
state that the extent of the sample size used for their surveys mean that they
are now "almost impossible to manipulate and very difficult for institutions
to ‘game’". They also state that "over 62,000 academic respondents contributed
to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent
academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable".
Furthermore, since 2013, the number of respondents to QS's Academic Reputation
Survey has increased again. Their survey now makes use of nearly 75,000
academic peer reviews, making it "to date, the world’s largest aggregation of
feeling in this [the global academic] community."[35][36][37]

The QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too
much emphasis on peer review, which receives 40 percent of the overall score.
Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the peer review
has been carried out.[38] In a report,[39] Peter Wills from the University of
Auckland, New Zealand wrote of the _Times Higher Education_ -QS World
University Rankings:

> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to
university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see
Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to
rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of
the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and
that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently
opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such
PR competitions.

However, QS state that no survey participant, academic or employer, is offered
a financial incentive to respond, while no academic is able to vote for their
own institution. This renders this particular criticism invalid, as it is
based on two incorrect premises: (1) that academics are currently financially
incentivized to participate, and (2) that conflicts of interests are created
by academics being able to vote for their own institution.

Academicians previously criticized of the use of the citation database,
arguing that it undervalues institutions which excel in the social sciences.
Ian Diamond, former chief executive of the Economic and Social Research
Council and now vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen and a member of
the THE editorial board, wrote to _Times Higher Education_ in 2007,
saying:[40]

> The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do
not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as
the natural sciences. Hence the low position of the London School of
Economics, caused primarily by its citations score, is a result not of the
output of an outstanding institution but the database and the fact that the
LSE does not have the counterweight of a large natural science base.

However, in 2015, QS's introduction of faculty area normalization ensured that
QS's rankings no longer conferred an undue advantage or disadvantage upon any
institution based on their particular subject specialisms. Correspondingly,
the London School of Economics rose from 71st in 2014 to 35th in 2015 and 37th
in 2016.[41]

Since the split from _Times Higher Education_ in 2009, further concerns about
the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several
experts.

In October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein,
Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder and Georg Winckler in the journal
_Scientomentrics_ for the unreliability of QS's methods:

> Several individual indicators from the Times Higher Education Survey (THES)
data base the overall score, the reported staff-to-student ratio, and the peer
ratings—demonstrate unacceptably high fluctuation from year to year. The
inappropriateness of the summary tabulations for assessing the majority of the
"top 200" universities would be apparent purely for reason of this obvious
statistical instability regardless of other grounds of criticism. There are
far too many anomalies in the change scores of the various indices for them to
be of use in the course of university management.[7]

In an article for the New Statesman entitled "The QS World University Rankings
are a load of old baloney", David Blanchflower, a leading labour economist,
said: "This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence
in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that
underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a
flawed index and should be ignored." [42]

However, Martin Ince,[12] chair of the Advisory Board for the Rankings, points
out that their volatility has been reduced since 2007 by the introduction of
the Z-score calculation method and that over time, the quality of QS's data
gathering has improved to reduce anomalies. In addition, the academic and
employer review are now so big that even modestly ranked universities receive
a statistically valid number of votes. QS has published extensive data [43] on
who the respondents are, where they are, and the subjects and industries to
which the academicians and employers respectively belong.

The QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who
points out that programmes which are known to be high quality, and which rank
highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare
poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[44] However,
the University of Pittsburgh was ranked in the number one position for
Philosophy in the 2016 QS World University Rankings by Subject, while Rutgers
University - another university that Leiter argued was given a strangely low
ranking - was ranked number three in the world in the same ranking. An
institution's score for each of QS's metrics can be found on the relevant
ranking page, allowing those wishing to examine why an institution has
finished in its final position to gain access to the scores that contributed
to the overall rank.[45]

In an article titled _The Globalisation of College and University Rankings_
and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of _Change_ magazine, Philip
Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of
the THE editorial board, said: "The QS World University Rankings are the most
problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational
indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant
variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries
employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix.
Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education
community is questionable."[46]

Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at University of Melbourne and
a member of the THE editorial board, in the article "Improving Latin American
universities' global ranking" for University World News on 10 June 2012, said:
"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently
robust to provide data valid as social science".[47] QS's Intelligence Unit
counter these criticisms by stating that "Independent academic reviews have
confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable".[36]

#### Results[edit]

The 2018 QS World University Rankings, published on June 8th 2017, was the
fourteenth edition of the overall ranking. It confirmed Massachusetts
Institute of Technology as the world's highest-ranked university for a sixth
successive year. In doing so, MIT equalled Harvard University's record of
consecutive number-one positions. 959 universities feature in the published
tables, representing 84 countries.[48]

### Young Universities[edit]

QS also releases the _QS Top 50 under 50 Ranking_ annually to rank
universities which have been established for under 50 years. These
institutions are judged based on their positions on the overall table of the
previous year.[57] From 2015, QS's "'Top 50 Under 50" ranking was expanded to
include the world's top 100 institutions under 50 years of age, while in 2017
it was again expanded to include the world's top 150 universities in this
cohort. In 2017, the table was topped by Nanyang Technological University of
Singapore for the fourth consecutive year. The table is dominated by
universities from the Asia-Pacific region, with the top six places taken by
Asian institutions. [58]

###  Faculties and subjects[edit]

QS also ranks universities by academic discipline organized into 5 faculties,
namely Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences & Medicine,
Natural Sciences and Social Sciences & Management. The methodology is based on
surveying expert academics and global employers, and measuring research
performance using data sourced from Elsevier's Scopus database. In the _2017
QS World University Rankings by Subject_ the world's best universities for the
study of 46 different subjects are named. The four new subject tables added in
the most recent edition are: Anatomy  & Physiology, Hospitality & Leisure
Management, Sports-related Subjects, and Theology.

The world's leading institution in 2017's tables in terms of most world-
leading positions is Harvard University, which is number one for 15 subjects.
Its longtime rankings rival, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is number
one for twelve subjects.[59]

## Regional rankings and other tables[edit]

### QS Graduate Employability Rankings[edit]

In 2015, in an attempt to meet student demand for comparative data about the
employment prospects offered by prospective or current universities, QS
launched the _QS Graduate Employability Rankings_. The most recent instalment,
released for the 2017/18 academic year, ranks 500 universities worldwide. It
is led by Stanford University, and features five universities from the United
States in the top 10.[60] The unique methodology consists of five indicators,
with three that do not feature in any other ranking.[61]

### Asia[edit]

In 2009, QS launched the _QS Asian University Rankings_ or _QS University
Rankings: Asia_ in partnership with _The Chosun Ilbo_ newspaper in Korea to
rank universities in Asia independently. The eighth instalment, released for
the 2016/17 academic year, ranks the 350 best universities in Asia, and is led
by the National University of Singapore.[65]

These rankings use some of the same criteria as the world rankings, but there
are changed weightings and new criteria. One addition is the criterion of
incoming and outgoing exchange students. Accordingly, the performance of Asian
institutions in the _QS World University Rankings_ and the _QS Asian
University Rankings_ released in the same academic year are different from
each other.[1]

### Latin America[edit]

The _QS Latin American University Rankings_ or _QS University Rankings: Latin
America_ were launched in 2011. They use academic opinion (30%), employer
opinion (20%), publications per faculty member, citations per paper, academic
staff with a PhD, faculty/student ratio and web visibility (10 per cent each)
as measures.[74]

The 2016/17 edition of the QS World University Rankings: Latin America ranks
the top 300 universities in the region. The Universidade de São Paulo retained
its status as the region's best university.[75]

### BRICS[edit]

This set of rankings adopts 8 indicators to select the top 100 higher learning
institutions in BRICS countries. Institutions in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan
are not ranked here, leaving those in mainland China alone.

### QS Best Student Cities Ranking[edit]

In 2012, QS launched the _QS Best Student Cities_ ranking - a table designed
to evaluate which cities were most likely to provide students with a high-
quality student experience. Five editions of the ranking have been published
thus far, with Paris taking the number-one position in four of
them.[85][86][87] The newest edition of the ranking was released on February
15, 2017. It saw Montreal take the number-one spot; in doing so, the city

was also the first one to see the introduction of student opinion as a
contributory indicator.

## QS Stars[edit]

QS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth
information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars,
this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a
detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern university. The
minimum score that a university can receive is one star, while truly
exceptional world-leading universities can receive '5*+', or 'Five Star Plus',
status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to 50
different indicators. By 2016, 16 different universities worldwide had been
awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[92]

QS Stars ratings are derived from scores on eleven criteria. Five of these are
mandatory, and institutions must choose two of four additional optional
categories[93]. They are:

  * Research Quality
  * Teaching Quality
  * Graduate Employability
  * University Infrastructure
  * Internationalisation
  * Facilities
  * Online/Distance learning
  * Social Responsibility
  * Arts and Culture
  * Inclusiveness
  * Special criteria for specific subjects[94]

Stars is an evaluation system, not a ranking. About 100 institutions had opted
for the Stars evaluation as of early 2013. In 2012, fees to participate in
this program were $9850 for the initial audit and an annual license fee of
$6850.[95]

It is a remarkably stable list, relying on long-term factors such as the number of Nobel Prize-winners a university has produced, and number of articles published in Nature and Science journals. But with this narrow focus comes drawbacks. China's priority was for its universities to "catch up" on hard scientific research. So if you're looking for raw research power, it's the list for you. If you're a humanities student, or more interested in teaching quality? Not so much.
