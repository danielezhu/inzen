The State Fair of Texas is an annual state fair held in Dallas at historic Fair Park. The fair has taken place every year since 1886 except for varying periods during World War I and World War II. It usually begins the last Friday in September and ends 24 days later. While the State Fair of Texas considers quantifying its official attendance figures "too much of a hassle", it is still consistently recognized as one of the most highly attended and best state fairs in America.
