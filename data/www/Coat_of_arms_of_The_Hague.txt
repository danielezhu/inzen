The coat of arms of The Hague is the official symbol of the city of The Hague.
It consists of a golden escutcheon with a stork in natural colors holding a black eel, a count's crown as coronet, and two golden lions rampant regardant as supporters standing on a green decorative compartment. On 27 September 2012, the motto Vrede en Recht (English: Peace and Justice) was added to the compartment, referring to the city's global recognition as the home of international justice and accountability.
