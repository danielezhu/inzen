The first attempt at producing pre-recorded HDTV media was a scarce Japanese analog MUSE-encoded laser disc which is no longer produced. See MUSE-LD.
In the U.S. market, the first currently available prerecorded HD media was D-Theater. Comprising less than 100 titles and utilizing a 28-Mbit/s MPEG2 stream at 720p or 1080i with either Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS encoding, D-Theater is an encrypted D-VHS format, and only D-Theater-capable D-VHS players can play back these tapes. This format is superior to broadcast HDTV due to its higher bandwidth and, of course, the ability to do non-realtime optimization of the encoding, which is not possible with broadcast HDTV. D-Theater is currently a small niche market even within the niche HDTV community, and it appears as if the final D-Theater title was published in 2005 with 20th Century Fox release of i,Robot.
In 2006, the first pre-recorded digital optical HDTV media were introduced. There were two competing standards, Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. The first HD DVD players and discs were released on April 18, 2006 in the United States. Blu-ray Disc was released on June 20, 2006.
