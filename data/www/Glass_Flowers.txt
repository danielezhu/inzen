The Glass Flowers, formally The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants, is a world famous collection of highly realistic glass botanical models at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH) at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture.

They were made by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in Hosterwitz, Germany, near Dresden. The collection was commissioned by Professor George Lincoln Goodale, the first director of Harvard's Botanical Museum, to aid in teaching botany and was financed by Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth C. Ware. There are 847 life-size models representing 780 species and varieties of plants in 164 families as well as over 3,000 models of details such as enlargements of plant parts and anatomical sections. The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models.
