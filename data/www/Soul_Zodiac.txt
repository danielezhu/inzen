Soul Zodiac is an album by jazz cornetist Nat Adderley released on the Capitol label featuring performances by Adderley's Sextet with Ernie Watts, Mike Deasy, George Duke, Walter Booker, and Roy McCurdy with narration by Rick Holmes and Cannonball Adderley guesting on two tracks. Because of the prominent production credit on the cover the album is often mistakenly credited to Cannonball Adderley. Also, Soul Zodiac is not to be confused with Cannonball Adderley's Love, Sex, and the Zodiac.
