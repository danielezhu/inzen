Let's Do it Again is a 1953 Technicolor musical film set in 1950 New York, and released by Columbia Pictures. The film was directed by Alexander Hall and starred Jane Wyman, Ray Milland, Aldo Ray, and Tom Helmore. It is the story of a composer's wife (Wyman) who tries to make him (Milland) jealous, but the ploy backfires and leads to divorce.
This color film is a reworking of a stage play by Arthur Richman, The Awful Truth (1922), which was previously filmed in 1925, again in 1929 (The Awful Truth), and in a 1937 film of that name starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant.
The lyrics for the musical numbers were written by Ned Washington.
