**Forbes Avenue** is one of the longest streets in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
United States. It has a length of about ten miles (16 km) and is named for
John Forbes (1707–1759), whose expedition recaptured Fort Duquesne and who
renamed the place Pittsburgh in 1758.

The westernmost terminus of Forbes Avenue lies at Stanwix Street in the
downtown part of the city, then runs eastward past PPG Place, directly through
Market Square and then between the Courthouse and the City-County Building,
past Duquesne University, through Uptown, and Oakland where it passes the
University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning and the Carnegie Library of
Pittsburgh. From Oakland, Forbes Avenue continues eastward past Carnegie
Mellon University and Schenley Park, through the neighborhood of Squirrel
Hill, and past Homewood Cemetery and Frick Park before it reaches its eastern
terminus at Wilkinsburg.
