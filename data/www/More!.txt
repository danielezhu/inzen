More! was a fortnightly (then weekly) women's fashion magazine and associated website published every Tuesday in the United Kingdom by Bauer London Lifestyle. It included celebrity news, high street fashion, and sex tips. The magazine was published fortnightly until September 2007, when it became a weekly publication to compete with Look. More USA is still published.
On 22 April 2013, Bauer Media Group announced that it would cease publication of More! Magazine and its website. In its closing web comments, the publishers reported that continuing challenging economic conditions meant that the product was no longer viable.
