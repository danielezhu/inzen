Digital booklets are the digital equivalent of liner notes that often accompany digital music purchases. They are most commonly distributed in Portable Document Format. One well-known distributor of digital booklets with digital purchases is the iTunes Store; the first instance of this on the iTunes Store was the release of the album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb by rock band U2.
