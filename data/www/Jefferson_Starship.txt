Jefferson Starship is an American rock band formed in the early 1970s by several members of the former Jefferson Airplane. The band has undergone several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the same Jefferson Starship name. It is not to be confused with Starship, a spin-off of the group, featuring former co-lead singer Mickey Thomas, that also periodically tours.
