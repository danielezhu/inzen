The Roman Rite (Ritus Romanus) the most widespread liturgical rite in the Catholic Church, is one of the Latin rites used in the Western or Latin Church. The Roman Rite has been adapted over the centuries and its Eucharistic liturgy can be divided into three stages: the Pre-Tridentine Mass, Tridentine Mass and Mass of Paul VI.
The 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum specifies the circumstances in which priests of the Latin Church may continue to use the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite in the 1962 Roman Missal.
