E minor is a minor scale consisting of the pitches E, F♯, G, A, B, C, and D. Its key signature has one sharp. The E harmonic minor raises the note D♮ to D♯.
Its relative major is G major, and its parallel major is E major.
Much of the classical guitar repertoire is in E minor, as this is a very natural key for the instrument. In standard tuning (E A D G B E), four of the instrument's six open (unfretted) strings are part of the tonic chord. The key of E minor is also popular in heavy metal music, as its tonic is the lowest note on a standard-tuned guitar.
