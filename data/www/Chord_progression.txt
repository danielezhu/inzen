A chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of musical chords. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in Western musical tradition.
In tonal music, chord progressions have the function of establishing or contradicting a tonality. Arnold Schoenberg distinguishes progressions from successions, which he describes as "aimless". A chord succession, he writes, "may be functionless, neither expressing an unmistakable tonality nor requiring a definite continuation". Chord progressions are usually expressed by Roman numerals.
