No Better Than This is an album by American singer-songwriter and musician John Mellencamp, produced by T Bone Burnett, that was released on August 17, 2010. The album was recorded at several historic locations throughout the United States. The title track was the album's first single and was sent to multiple radio formats on June 28, 2010.
Mellencamp said that the album is "as American folk as I've ever been." He also told Rolling Stone in July 2009 that he's not concerned whether or not there's a large audience for such a raw, simple record. "I am done being a rock star," Mellencamp said. "I have no interest in that, in having the biggest concerts. I have only one interest: to have fun while weâ€™re doing this and maybe have something that somebody might discover."
Rolling Stone placed No Better Than This No. 12 on its list of the best albums of 2010.
