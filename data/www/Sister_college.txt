Harvard University and Yale University in the USA, and the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge and the University of Dublin in Britain & Ireland, have a tradition of pairing their respective residential colleges or Houses with one another. Colleges that are paired are referred to as sister colleges, and have a ceremonial and symbolic relationship to one another. Students at one college can often find accommodation at their sister college should they be visiting the other University; this is especially relevant to Harvard and Yale students during the annual Game.
