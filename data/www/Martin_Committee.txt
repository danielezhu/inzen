Martin Committee was the trademark name of the Martin Band Instrument Company's premier lines of trumpets and saxophones starting in the mid-1930s. The firm produced band instruments, including trumpets, cornets, fluegelhorns, trombones, and saxophones from 1908 to the 1960s. The Martin Committee trumpets and saxophones were favorites of jazz musicians. All were produced in Elkhart, Indiana. In the postwar era the Martin Committee saxophones were branded "The Martin (saxophone type)," with the "Committee" designation eventually discontinued.
