Medic was an American medical drama that aired on NBC beginning in 1954. Medic was television's first doctor drama to focus attention on medical procedures.
Created by its principal writer James E. Moser, Medic tried to create realism (The Doctor and City Hospital had not) which would typify medical shows from then on. Moser had previously written for the radio shows Dragnet and Dr. Kildare. He went on to write the television series Ben Casey.
