Ellington Indigos is a 1958 jazz album by Duke Ellington.
The stereo CD reissue released by Columbia (CK 4444) in 1987 contains a track listing and cover art that is drastically different from the original mono LP. A change in song order and two "new" songs — "Night and Day" and "All The Things You Are" — were added to the CD while "The Sky Fell Down" was omitted.
