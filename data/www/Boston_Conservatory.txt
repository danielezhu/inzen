The Boston Conservatory is a formerly independent performing arts conservatory located in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It grants undergraduate and graduate degrees in music, dance and theater. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, Master of Fine Arts, and Master of Music degrees, as well as Graduate Performance Diplomas, Artist Diplomas, and Professional Studies Certificates. The Boston Conservatory was founded in 1867.
In recent years, the school has increasingly become informally known as "BoCo", both on campus and in the larger community.
In December 2015, Berklee College of Music and The Boston Conservatory agreed to merge. The merger was effective as of Summer 2016. The combined institution, located in Boston’s historic Back Bay and Fenway neighborhoods, is now known as “Berklee”, with the Conservatory being “Boston Conservatory at Berklee”.
