A mixtape (also mix-tape or mix tape) is a home-made compilation of music (typically copyrighted songs taken from other sources) recorded in a specific order, traditionally onto a cassette tape, though later replaced by CD or MP3 playlist formats. The songs can be sequential, or made into a continuous program by beatmatching the songs and creating seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings by use of fades or abrupt edits. Compilations may include a selection of favorite songs, or music linked by theme or mood, perhaps tailored to the tape's intended recipient.
Writing in 2004, essayist Geoffrey O'Brien called the personal mix tape "perhaps the most widely practiced American art form".
"Mixtape" is also used in hip hop to describe certain types of recordings, typically self-produced and independently released albums that are issued free of charge to gain publicity and/or circumvent possible copyright infringement.
