Ezra Stiles College is a residential college at Yale University, built in 1961 by Eero Saarinen. It is often simply called "Stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. It was named for Ezra Stiles, seventh president of Yale. Architecturally, it is known for its lack of right angles between walls in the living areas. It sits next to Morse College.
