Prior to 1990 and the start of the Gulf War, Kuwait was known in the region for its exploration of many different and new forms of music and dance. However, after encounters with Iraqi soldiers in August 1990, Kuwait fell and its music was destroyed along with its oil fields. After just seven months under Iraqi conquest, Kuwaitâ€™s thousands of years of rich and diverse music was nearly completely destroyed.
Traditional Kuwaiti music is derived from Kuwait's seafaring heritage. The Kuwaiti maritime tradition is known for songs called "Fidjeri". "Al Arda Al Bahariya" is a well-known Kuwaiti sailor song, as are the "al-Nahma", a class of songs that accompanied many sailing activities. Kuwaiti music reflects the diverse influence of many cultures, including India and East Africa.
Kuwait was the pioneer of contemporary music in the Gulf. Kuwaitis were the first commercial recording artists in the Gulf. Nawal El Kuwaiti, Nabeel Shoail, Abdul Kareem Abdul-Qader and Abdallah Al Rowaished are the most prominent modern performers.
