A stage piano is an electronic musical instrument designed for use in live performance on a stage, piano bar or a studio, as well as for music recording in popular music. While stage pianos share some of the same features as digital pianos designed for home use and synthesizers, they have a number of features which set them apart. Stage pianos usually provide a smaller number of sounds (acoustic piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ), with these sounds being of higher quality, unlike regular digital pianos and home synthesizers.
Unlike many digital pianos, which are designed for semi-permanent installation in a private home, and which have design elements which make regular transportation difficult (e.g., permanently mounted legs, modesty panel, internal power amplifier and speakers and a fixed sustain pedal), which would require a van and movers to relocate, a stage piano generally has a portable, detachable stand, no internal amp or speakers (an output jack is provided so the instrument can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier), and a detachable sustain pedal plugged into a jack. This enables a performer to remove all the detachable parts and makes it easier to transport the instrument to gigs and rehearsals.
