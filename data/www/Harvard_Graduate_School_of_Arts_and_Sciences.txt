The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) is the academic unit responsible for many post-baccalaureate degree programs offered through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. GSAS offers several master's degree programs—Master of Arts (AM), Master of Science (SM), and Master of Engineering (ME)—and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in more than fifty divisions, departments, and committees, spanning subjects in both the sciences and the humanities, including several interdepartmental programs. GSAS also administers the Graduate Special Student Program, which enables individuals who hold the baccalaureate degree to take graduate-level courses on a non-degree basis, and the Visiting Fellow Program, which enables advanced doctoral students and persons who already hold the PhD to conduct research at Harvard. Finally, GSAS also nominally oversees PhD programs in Harvard's professional schools: the Harvard Business School, Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, the basic science departments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Graduate School of Design, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
