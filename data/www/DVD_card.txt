A DVD card, also called Business Card DVD, is a DVD with the size and shape of a business card. Much like a traditional DVD, is an optical based media whose primary function is DVD-video playback and data storage. In recent years, the DVD card format has been used in the retail market to distribute sports and entertainment titles. However, leveraging its affinity with business, loyalty and payment cards, the DVD Card has also been used for promotional and marketing purposes.
A DVD card contains data accessible by a computer, DVD player, PlayStation, Xbox, and most other devices that have the ability to read digital video disc (DVD) technology. Content on the card may range from movies and music to interactive games. When played in a computer, the card may connect to the Internet and drive traffic to web sites or pull information from online databases.
