"Baby Won't You Please Come Home" is a blues song written by Charles Warfield and Clarence Williams in 1919. The song's authorship is disputed; Warfield claims that he was the sole composer of the song.
The song has been covered by a large number of musicians and has become a jazz standard. The first hit version was Bessie Smith's 1923 recording, which stayed on four weeks on the charts peaking at No. 6.
