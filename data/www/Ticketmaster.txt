Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc. is an American ticket sales (primary ticket outlet) and distribution company based in West Hollywood, California, with operations in many countries around the world. In 2010 it merged with Live Nation (events promoter) to become Live Nation Entertainment. As a primary ticket outlet, most US ticket sales for US venues are fulfilled at Ticketmaster's two main fulfillment centers located in Charleston, West Virginia, and Pharr, Texas. Typically, Ticketmaster's clients (promoters) control their events, and Ticketmaster acts as an agent, selling the tickets that the clients make available to them.
On 10 January 2008, Ticketmaster completed the acquisition of Paciolan Inc., a developer of ticketing system applications and hosted ticketing systems, after litigation over the potential breach of antitrust laws. In January 2009, Ticketmaster acquired a UK ticket exchange site, Getmein.com. Getmein is a ticket exchange site that allows sellers to list the tickets at whatever price they choose.
On 10 February 2009, Ticketmaster and Live Nation, the largest concert promoter, officially announced their merger deal. After almost a year of review, the two companies merged on 25 January 2010, under the name Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV). To satisfy one of the United States Department of Justice's conditions of approval for the merger, Ticketmaster sold Paciolan to Comcast Spectacor in March 2010.
