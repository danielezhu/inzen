Legacy Recordings is an American record label that is a division of Sony Music Entertainment. Formed in 1990 after Sony's acquiring of CBS Records, Legacy handles the archives of Sony Music-owned labels Columbia Records, Epic Records, RCA Records, RCA Records Nashville, J Records, Windham Hill Records, Arista, LaFace, Jive, Buddah Records, and Philadelphia International Records. It also handles the catalog of recordings produced by Phil Spector.
This is not to be confused with the defunct British independent label Legacy Records.
