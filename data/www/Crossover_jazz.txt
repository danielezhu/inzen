Crossover jazz is a genre of music that is rooted in jazz but aims for mainstream popularity. Crossover was popular in the early 1970s. Crossover jazz retains an emphasis on improvisation but attempts to make that improvisation commercially successful. A frequently cited example of crossover is the music of Eumir Deodato.
