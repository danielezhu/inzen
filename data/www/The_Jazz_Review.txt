The Jazz Review was a magazine which was founded by Nat Hentoff, Martin Williams, and Hsio Wen Shih, in New York City in 1958. It was published until 1961. Hentoff and Williams were co-editors throughout its brief existence.
Many issues of The Jazz Review are available at Jazz Studies Online which assesses its quality as follows:

While all of the material is of high quality, several features are particularly distinctive: the regular reviews of musicians' work by other musicians; Hentoff's regular column "Jazz in Print", which deals with the politics of the music business as well as of the nation; and the incorporation of a wide range of musical styles and approaches to discussing jazz.

A regular feature of The Jazz Review was "The Blues", a page of transcriptions of the lyrics from blues recordings by a variety of singers, e.g., in the seventh issue:
Crying Mother Blues, Red Nelson
Six Cold Feet in the Ground, Leroy Carr
Patrol Wagon Blues, Henry Allen
