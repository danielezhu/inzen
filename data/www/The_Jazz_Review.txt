The Jazz Review was a magazine which was founded by Nat Hentoff, Martin Williams, and Hsio Wen Shih, in New York City in 1958. It was published until 1961. Hentoff and Williams were co-editors throughout its brief existence.
Many issues of The Jazz Review are available at Jazz Studies Online which assesses its quality as follows:

While all of the material is of high quality, several features are particularly distinctive: the regular reviews of musicians' work by other musicians; Hentoff's regular column "Jazz in Print", which deals with the politics of the music business as well as of the nation; and the incorporation of a wide range of musical styles and approaches to discussing jazz.

A regular feature of The Jazz Review was "The Blues", a page of transcriptions of the lyrics from blues recordings by a variety of singers, e.g., in the seventh issue:
Crying Mother Blues, Red Nelson
Six Cold Feet in the Ground, Leroy Carr
Patrol Wagon Blues, Henry Allen

^ Hsio Wen Shih, who contributed an article on blues singers to the initial issue of The Jazz Review, was "an architect and expert in acoustics, ...a student of the music of many cultures", according to that issue. "The Jazz Review, Vol. 1, No. 1, Nov. 1958, page 50". Retrieved 2016-01-29.
