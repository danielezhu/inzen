The Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the Official Opposition in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having won the second-largest number of seats in the 2017 general election. The party's current leader, Jeremy Corbyn is Leader of the Opposition. The Labour Party's platform emphasises a larger state, social justice and strengthening workers' rights.
The Labour Party was founded in 1900, having grown out of the trade union movement and socialist parties of the nineteenth century. It overtook the Liberal Party to become the main opposition to the Conservative Party in the early 1920s, forming minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and from 1929 to 1931. Labour later served in the wartime coalition from 1940 to 1945, after which it formed a majority government under Clement Attlee. Labour was also in government from 1964 to 1970 under Harold Wilson and from 1974 to 1979, first under Wilson and then under James Callaghan.
The Labour Party was most recently in government from 1997 to 2010 under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, first elected with a landslide majority of 179, reduced to 66 by the 2005. Since leaving government, the party has been led by Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn.
The Labour Party is currently the largest party in the Welsh Assembly, forming the main party in the current Welsh government. The party is also the third largest in the Scottish Parliament and sends the second most MEPs from the United Kingdom to the European Parliament, sitting in the Socialists and Democrats Group. Whilst the party also organises in Northern Ireland, it does not contest elections there, instead supporting the Social Democratic and Labour Party.
The Labour Party is a full member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance, and holds observer status in the Socialist International.
