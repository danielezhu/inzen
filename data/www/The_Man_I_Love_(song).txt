"The Man I Love" is a popular standard, with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by his brother Ira Gershwin. Originally part of the 1924 score for the Gershwin government satire Lady, Be Good as "The Girl I Love", the song was deleted from the show as well as from both the 1927 anti-war satire Strike Up the Band (where it first appeared as "The Man I Love") and 1928 Ziegfeld hit Rosalie after tryouts. It is the basis for the 1947 film The Man I Love starring Ida Lupino and Bruce Bennett and featured prominently throughout.
As with many standards of the era, it has become more famous as an independent popular song than as one from a Broadway musical.
The song was included in the 2015 Broadway musical An American In Paris based on the movie of same name.
