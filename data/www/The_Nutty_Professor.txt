The Nutty Professor is a 1963 American science fiction-romantic comedy film produced, directed, co-written (with Bill Richmond) and starring Jerry Lewis. The score was composed by Walter Scharf. The film is a parody of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
In 2004, The Nutty Professor was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
In 1996, a remake starring Eddie Murphy and Jada Pinkett-Smith was released, directed by Tom Shadyac.
