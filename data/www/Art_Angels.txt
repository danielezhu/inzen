Art Angels is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer and songwriter Claire Boucher, professionally known as Grimes. It was digitally released on November 6, 2015 by 4AD, and in physical formats on December 11. Boucher began planning the record in 2013 as the follow-up to her third studio album Visions, however she scrapped most of the material from these sessions and began a new set of recordings in 2014. The track "Realiti", which came from the earlier recordings, was released as a demo in early 2015.
Art Angels has been described as being more accessible than Boucher's previous albums while retaining her experimental influences. The album features guest appearances by Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes and American singer Janelle Monáe. The album spawned two singles—"Flesh Without Blood" and "Kill V. Maim"—as well as music videos for several tracks. Art Angels sold 11,000 copies in its first week in the United States and became Boucher's highest-charting album so far. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim and was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of 2015.
