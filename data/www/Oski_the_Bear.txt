Oski or Oski the Bear (named after the Oski Yell) is the official mascot of the University of California, Berkeley. Oski’s name, design and character were developed by William “Rocky” Rockwell, who was the first student to play the role, and former Daily Cal editor Warrington Colescott. Oski made his debut during the September 27, 1941 football season-opener against St. Mary's College and has been the university’s official mascot ever since. Up until 1941, live bears were used as mascots. After 1946, the bear's activities have been overseen by the Oski Committee, which also appoints a new Oski whenever a replacement is required. Oski's identity is protected by the Committee and wearers of the suit generally do not disclose their having worn the suit. There may be multiple members of the Committee who wear the suit depending on their schedules.
