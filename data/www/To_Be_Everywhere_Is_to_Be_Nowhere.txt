To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Thrice. The album was released on May 27, 2016 through Vagrant Records. To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere is Thrice's first release after coming out of four-year hiatus—from mid-2012 to mid-2015—and first album of original material in five years since 2011's Major/Minor. Most of the band members continued performing music and pursuing other interests during the hiatus, which included moving to new cities or states with their new families. After reuniting and performing sporadic festival dates in 2015, Thrice announced their intention to release a new album the following year. Because of the distance between the members' new homes, the demos for To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere were written, recorded, shared and collaborated on digitally through various software programs that weren't as prevalent before they went on hiatus. The album was produced by Eric Palmquist and features more politically and/or socially charged lyrics than has been seen on previous Thrice albums.
Thrice formally announced To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere in March 2016, and have released two singles in support of the album, "Black Honey" in May 2016, and "Hurricane" in April 2017. Because most members of Thrice settled down and started families during their hiatus, the band decided to be more selective about their touring schedules after reforming in order to spend more time at home.
