"The Windmills of Your Mind" is a song with music by French composer Michel Legrand and English lyrics written by Americans Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman. The melody was adopted from the first two opening measures of Mozart's Second movement of his "Symphonie Concertante". The French lyrics, under the title "Les moulins de mon c≈ìur", were written by Eddy Marnay. The song (with the English lyrics) was introduced in the film The Thomas Crown Affair (1968).
Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1968, "Windmills of Your Mind " was in 2004 ranked at no. 57 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. A remake by Sting was utilized in the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair.
