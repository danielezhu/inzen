Voice acting is the art of doing voice-overs or providing voices to represent a character or to provide information to an audience or user. Examples include animated, off-stage, off-screen or non-visible characters in various works, including feature films, dubbed foreign language films, animated short films, television programs, commercials, radio or audio dramas, comedy, video games, puppet shows, amusement rides, audiobooks, and documentaries. Voice acting is also done for small handheld audio games.
Performers are called voice actors or actresses, voice artists, or voice talent. Their roles may also involve singing, although a second voice actor is sometimes cast as the character's singing voice. Voice acting is recognised in Britain as a specialized dramatic profession, chiefly owing to the BBC's long tradition of radio drama.
Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement.
