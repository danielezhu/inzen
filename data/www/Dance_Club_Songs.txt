The Dance Club Songs chart is a weekly chart published exclusively by Billboard in the United States. It is a national survey of the songs which are the most popular in nightclubs across the country and is compiled from reports from a national sample of disc jockeys. It was launched as the Disco Action Top 30 chart on August 28, 1976, and became the first chart by Billboard to document the popularity of dance music. Since its inception, several artists have set various records and garnered multiple achievements. In January 2017, Billboard proclaimed Madonna as the most successful artist in the history of the chart, ranking her first in their list of the 100 top all time dance artists; she also holds the record for the most number-one songs, with 46. Katy Perry holds the record for having seventeen consecutive number-one songs, an unbroken streak; her third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010), also holds the record for being the only album in the history of the chart to produce at least seven number-one songs.
The first number-one song on the Dance Club Songs chart for the issue dated August 28, 1976, was "You Should Be Dancing" by the Bee Gees; it spent five weeks atop the chart and was the group's only number-one song. The current number-one song on the Dance Club Songs chart for the issue dated July 8, 2017, is "Ghosting" by Joe Bermudez featuring Megn.
