Sierra Leone's music is a mixture of native, French, British, West Indian and Creole musical genres.
Palm wine music is representative, played by an acoustic guitar with percussion in countries throughout coastal West Africa.
Sierra Leone, like much of West Africa is open to Rap, Reggae, Dancehall, R&B, and Grime (music).
