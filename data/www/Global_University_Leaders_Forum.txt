The **Global University Leaders Forum** (GULF), a group of CEOs from 26 top
world universities, was established in 2006 to foster collaboration in areas
of global policy importance and to assist in shaping the World Economic
Forum's agenda. The community is currently focusing on two topics: the future
of higher education, and the role of science in society.[1]

Membership is based on university ranking, individual leadership, geographical
diversity, and the university's relevance to the forum's agenda.[2]
