The Bobby Broom Organi-Sation is a Chicago based jazz organ trio composed of jazz guitarist Bobby Broom, Hammond B3 organist Ben Paterson and drummers Makaya McCraven or Kobie Watkins. Broom is a three-time DownBeat Critics Poll honoree for his work as one of the top jazz guitarists in the world, McCraven and Watkins also perform with Broom's main group, The Bobby Broom Trio.

The Bobby Broom Organi-Sation opened for Steely Dan on their Jamalot Ever After 2014 national tour that spanned 52 dates, and 43 cities, across the United States and Canada.
