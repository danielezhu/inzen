"Around the World" was the theme tune from the 1956 movie Around the World in 80 Days  In the film, only an instrumental version of the song appeared, although the vocal version has become by far the better known one. The song was written by Harold Adamson and Victor Young; Young died in 1956, several weeks after the film's release and he received the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture posthumously.  Young's orchestral version was a #13 hit on the Billboard charts in 1957. The recording by Bing Crosby was the B-side of the Victor Young version in 1957, on Festival SP45-1274 in Australia, and was a joint charting success.
