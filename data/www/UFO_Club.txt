The UFO Club (pronounced Yoof-oh, as in "euphoria") was a famous but short-lived UK underground club in London during the 1960s. It was established by Joe Boyd and John 'Hoppy' Hopkins and featured light shows, poetry readings, well-known rock acts such as Jimi Hendrix, avant-garde art by Yoko Ono, as well as local house bands such as Pink Floyd and Soft Machine.
