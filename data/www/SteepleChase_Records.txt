SteepleChase Records is a jazz record company and label based in Copenhagen, Denmark. SteepleChase was founded in 1972 by Nils Winther, who was a student at Copenhagen University at the time. He began recording performances at Jazzhus Montmartre, where mmany American expatriates played, and was given permission by some of the artists to release the material on record.
SteepleChase became a haven for many artists who had lost contracts with larger labels after the 1960s. In 1987 the label also started the classical label Kontrapunkt.
