The flag of the City and County of San Francisco, which depicts a rising phoenix, is often assumed to be symbol of the city's recovery from the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fires. However, the flag itself dates several years earlier to around 1900. It was officially adopted as the flag of San Francisco on December 16, 1940.
