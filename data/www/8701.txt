8701 is the third studio album by American singer Usher; it was first released on August 7, 2001, by Arista Records. Recording was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, Babyface, Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Although intended for an October 31, 2000, release under the title All About U, the album was delayed numerous times, following the leak of several tracks onto the online music store Napster. Usher subsequently recorded new tracks and released the album under the new title, 8701, which is derived from Usher singing for the first time in his local church in 1987 and the album's release date of 2001.
8701 takes inspiration from multiple artists, including Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson. It follows the theme of Usher's relationship experience, along with the emotions of love and heartache. Usher promoted the album by embarking on the supporting tour, Evolution 8701 Tour in 2002, to which it he performed in forty-four shows across North America. He also made appearances in television shows, including Live! with Kelly and Total Request Live. 8701 produced two Billboard Hot 100 number one singles – "U Remind Me" and "U Got It Bad" stayed on top for four and five weeks, respectively.
The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, with 210,000 copies sold in its first week. It has sold over 4.7 million copies in the United States, receiving a 4× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); worldwide sales stand at over eight million. 8701 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Usher's vocals and development as an artist, but were ambivalent towards some of the album's material. The album earned Usher numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and a BET Award.
