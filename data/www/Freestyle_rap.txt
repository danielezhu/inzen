Freestyle is a style of improvisation with or without instrumental beats, in which lyrics are recited with no particular subject or structure It is similar to other improvisational music, such as jazz (Myka 9 of Freestyle Fellowship describes it as being "like a jazz solo"), where there is a lead instrumentalist acting as the improviser and the rest of the band providing the beat. Improv/freestyles are improvised in this way.
