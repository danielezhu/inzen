"Singing in the Bathtub" is a song written in 1929 by Michael H. Cleary, with lyrics by Herb Magidson and Ned Washington for the film The Show of Shows. The Show of Shows was Warner Bros.' answer to MGM's The Hollywood Revue of 1929, and "Singing in the Bathtub" spoofs Hollywood Revue's song "Singin' in the Rain". In Show of Shows, the number features an enormous bathtub and is performed by Winnie Lightner and a chorus of male performers (some dressed as women) wearing antiquated bathing suits.
The song was recorded by many performers of the time, including Guy Lombardo, Dorothy Provine, Dick Robertson, King Ben Nawahi, Gracie Fields, Vaughn De Leath, The Georgians, and Danny Kaye, and more recently by Robert Crumb, John Lithgow, Mic Conway and Mandy Patinkin. In Vaughn DeLeath's rendition of the song, she sings the line "the ring around the bathtub is a rainbow to me" as "a rainbow from me", substantially changing its meaning.
The lyrics often include a quotation of the title air from "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles".
