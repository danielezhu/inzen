Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas is a 1976 double live album by the Allman Brothers Band.
It collected a variety of performances from the mid-1970s line-up of the band. Songs from their popular 1973 Brothers and Sisters album were heavily featured, but each of their other studio albums was represented by a selection as well.
Released after the group had already dissolved in acrimony, the album did not attract much praise or even attention at the time. The band did not like the selections, the sound mixing on the album was poor, the packaging was substandard, and the record also inevitably suffered by comparison to their classic 1971 At Fillmore East, generally considered one of the best live albums of all time.
Nevertheless, some of the 1973 performances, such as of "Southbound", are strong, and the energetic 1975 run-through of "Can't Lose What You Never Had" showed why it had enjoyed much of the progressive rock radio airplay off that year's Win, Lose or Draw. The New Year's Eve 1972 nightclub performance of "Ain't Wastin' Time No More", a number originally recorded shortly after the band lost Duane Allman and now being played shortly after the band lost Berry Oakley, illustrated the group's mixture of lament and resolve.
The album's title is derived from the song "Too Much Monkey Business" by Chuck Berry. Album cover art was by Jim Evans.
