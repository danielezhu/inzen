Boylston Street is the name of a major east-west thoroughfare in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. The Boston street was known as Frog Lane in the early 18th century and was later known as Common Street. It was later again renamed for Ward Nicholas Boylston (1747â€“1828), a man of wealth and refinement, an officer of the Crown, and philanthropist. Boylston, who was a descendent of Zabdiel Boylston, was born in Boston and spent much of his life in it. The Boylston Market was named after him as was the town of Boylston, Massachusetts.
Another Boylston Street runs through Boston's western suburbs, Newton and Brookline.
