Ashgate Publishing was an academic book and journal publisher based in Farnham (Surrey, United Kingdom). It was established in 1967 and specialised in the social sciences, arts, humanities and professional practice. It had an American office in Burlington, Vermont, and another British office in London. It is now a subsidiary of Informa (Taylor & Francis).
The company had two imprints: Gower Publishing published professional business and management titles, and Lund Humphries – established over 60 years ago – publishes illustrated art books, particularly in the field of modern British art. In March 2015, Gower unveiled GpmFirst, a web-based community of practice allowing subscribers access to more than 120 project management titles, as well as discussions and articles relevant to business and project management.
In July 2015, it was announced that Ashgate had been sold to Informa for a reported £20M. It was announced in December 2015 that Lund Humphries has been relaunched as an independent publisher. By February 2016, the independent imprints of Ashgate became part of the Routledge imprint.
