David Obst is an American literary agent and author. Obst was the agent of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. He also was involved in the productions of the films Revenge of the Nerds, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and All the President's Men.
Alex Kyczynski of The New York Times stated, "Obst says he was born in 1946, but he also says his mother was pregnant with him a month after D-Day, so we can't be sure how accurate a historian he is to begin with." Obst originated from Culver City, California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley.
Around 1969 Obst went to Taiwan to study the Chinese language and later moved to Washington, DC where he became Seymour Hersh's literary agent. Obst had associated with Abbie Hoffman.
