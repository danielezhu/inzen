"Yesterdays" is a 1933 song composed by Jerome Kern, with lyrics by Otto Harbach.
It was written for the show Roberta (1933), where it was introduced by Fay Templeton. The song was soon picked up by jazz musicians and has since gone on to become one of the top jazz standards. JazzStandards.com (see "External links" below) ranks it ninth among all jazz standards, in terms of being "included most often on currently issued CDs by the greatest number of jazz artists."
