The Professional Arts Consortium (also known as ProArts) is an association of six Boston, Massachusetts institutions of higher education which emphasize the visual, applied, and performing arts. The consortium allows for shared resources, such as libraries, between member schools. Students of member schools may also cross-register for courses in any other member school. It also maintains the Boston Arts Academy (BAA), a partnership with the Boston Public Schools. It is made up of Berklee College of Music, Boston Architectural College, Boston Conservatory, Emerson College, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.
