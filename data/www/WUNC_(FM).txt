WUNC is the flagship National Public Radio member station for the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, broadcasting on the FM band at 91.5 MHz. Based in Chapel Hill and operated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, it airs NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International, and BBC programming in an "all-news-and-information" format. On the weekends, the network broadcasts locally produced folk music programming; the longest-running continuously produced program offered by the station is Back Porch Music, a weekly folk and traditional music program.
WUNC should not be confused with WXYC, which is UNC's student radio station.
The station operates four full-service FM repeater stations, WFSS-FM from Fayetteville on 91.9; WRQM from Rocky Mount on 90.9; WUND-FM from Manteo on 88.9; and WUNW-FM from Welcome on 91.1.
