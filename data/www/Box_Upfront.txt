Box Upfront (formerly Heat) is a British music television channel owned by The Box Plus Network, a joint venture between Bauer Media Group and Channel Four Television Corporation. It launched on 3 July 2012, and was originally based on the magazine of the same name. The channel replaced Q.
The channel features daily celebrity gossip show Heat's Huge News, as well as a 60-minute programme rounding up weeks stories, titled Heat's Huge Week of News, which is produced by ITN. In addition, ITN Productions co-produces celebrity documentary series Real Stories with Box Television. Heat also features The Heat-Ometer, its pick of the 20 biggest music videos narrated by Heat editor, Lucie Cave.
On 2 April 2013, all Box Television channels went free-to-air on satellite, apart from 4Music which went free-to-view. As a result, the channels were removed from the Sky EPG in Ireland. However, Heat launched on Freesat on 29 April 2013, alongside Magic, following the addition of four other Box Television channels on 15 April.
On 25 May 2016, the channel was rebranded as Box Upfront.
