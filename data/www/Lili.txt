Lili is a 1953 American film released by MGM. It stars Leslie Caron as a touchingly na√Øve French girl whose emotional relationship with a carnival puppeteer is conducted through the medium of four puppets. The screenplay by Helen Deutsch was adapted from "The Man Who Hated People", a short story by Paul Gallico which appeared in the October 28, 1950, issue of The Saturday Evening Post.
It won the Academy Award for Best Music, and was also entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.
Following the film's success, Gallico expanded his story into a 1954 novella entitled The Love of Seven Dolls. The film was adapted for the stage under the title Carnival! (1961).
