The MTV Awards (known as TRL Awards from 2006 to 2012) were established in 2006 by MTV Italy to celebrate the most popular artists and music videos in Italy. Originally beginning as an annual event to celebrate the most request videos and artists on Total Request Live, from 2013 the MTV Awards are celebration of what MTV Italian viewers consider the best in music, cinema and fashion.
From 2006 to 2010 the show changed its host city every year, and from 2011-2016 was set in Florence before moving to Rome in 2017. The awards are presented annually and broadcast live on MTV Italy, as well as online.
