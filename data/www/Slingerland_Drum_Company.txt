Slingerland is an American drum kits brand, currently owned by Gibson. The brand is strongly related to jazz drummers, such as Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich, who used to play signature instruments made by the company.
Slingerland also produced electric and acoustic guitars, mandolins and banjos during the 1930s.
