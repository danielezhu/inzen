Pearson Education is a British-owned education publishing and assessment service to schools and corporations, as well as directly to students. Pearson owns educational media brands including Addisonâ€“Wesley, Peachpit, Prentice Hall, eCollege, Longman, Poptropica, Scott Foresman, and others.
Pearson is part of Pearson PLC, which formerly owned the Financial Times. It was created in July 1998 when Pearson PLC purchased the education division of Simon & Schuster from Viacom and merged it with its own education division, Addison-Wesley Longman, to form Pearson Education. Pearson Education was rebranded to Pearson in 2011 and split into an International and a North American division.
Although Pearson generates approximately 60% of its sales in North America, it operates in more than 70 countries. Pearson International is headquartered in London, and it maintains offices across Europe, Asia and South America. Its online chat support is based in the Philippines.
Pearson North America is headquartered at 330 Hudson in New York City, New York. It previously was located in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.
Pearson Italia SpA, also known as Pearson Paravia Bruno Mondadori, was created through the purchase of PBM Editori, which was in turn a merge of Paravia (based in Turin) and Bruno Mondadori (based in Milan).
