Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church or the Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the "canon", or list, of recognized saints. Originally, persons were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes were developed, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church.
