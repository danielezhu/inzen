All Songs Considered is a weekly online multimedia program started in January 2000 by NPR's All Things Considered director Bob Boilen. At first, the show featured information and streaming audio about the songs used as bumper music on All Things Considered. The program has turned into a source of discovery for new music of all genres. In August 2005, the program began podcasting for free. In 2005, it began webcasting and podcasting live concerts from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club, including acts such as Animal Collective, The Decemberists, Neko Case and Tom Waits.
Host Bob Boilen and producer/co-host Robin Hilton write a blog where they introduce music from unsigned and unknown bands and solicit ideas for shows from listeners. There is also an online music channel, "All Songs 24/7", streaming music from the programâ€™s archive.
In 2007, All Songs Considered became the cornerstone program of NPR Music, the music discovery web site from National Public Radio. Some NPR stations also directly broadcast the program on terrestrial radio.
