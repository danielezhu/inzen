Luciano Pozo González, better known as Chano Pozo (January 7, 1915 in Havana – December 3, 1948 in New York City) was a Cuban jazz percussionist, singer, dancer and composer. Despite only living to age 33, he played a major role in the founding of Latin jazz. He was also a key influence on trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie, co-writing some of Gillespie's Latin-flavored compositions including "Manteca" and "Tin Tin Deo", and serving as the first Latin percussionist in Gillespie's band.
