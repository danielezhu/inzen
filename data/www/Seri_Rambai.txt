The Seri Rambai is a 17th-century Dutch cannon displayed at Fort Cornwallis in George Town, the capital city of the Malaysian state of Penang and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia, largely seen as a fertility symbol, and the subject of legends and prophecy.
The cannon's history in the Malacca Straits began in early 1600s, when Dutch East India Company (VOC) officers gave it to the Sultan of Johor in return for trading concessions. Less than a decade later, Johor was destroyed, the sultan captured and the Seri Rambai taken to Aceh. Near the end of the eighteenth century the cannon was sent to Selangor and mounted next to one of the town's hilltop forts. In 1871 pirates seized a Penang junk, murdered its passengers and crew, and took the stolen vessel to Selangor. The British colonial government responded by burning the town, destroying its forts and confiscating the Seri Rambai.
The gun was originally displayed at George Town's Esplanade; in the 1950s, it was moved a short distance away to the ramparts of Fort Cornwallis.
