In the United States, an administrative or political subdivision of a state is a county, which is a region having specific boundaries and usually some level of governmental authority. The term "county" is used in 48 U.S. states, while Louisiana and Alaska have functionally equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs respectively.
Most counties have subdivisions which may include municipalities and unincorporated areas. Others have no further divisions, or may serve as a singular consolidated city-county. Some municipalities are in multiple counties; New York City is uniquely partitioned into multiple counties/boroughs.
The U.S. federal government uses the term "county equivalent" to describe non-county administrative or statistical areas that are comparable to counties. Louisiana parishes; the organized boroughs of Alaska; the District of Columbia; and the independent cities of the states of Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada are equivalent to counties for administrative purposes. Alaska's Unorganized Borough is divided into 11 census areas that are statistically equivalent to counties. As of 2013, the United States has 3,007 counties and 137 county equivalents for a total of 3,144 counties and county equivalents.
The number of counties per state ranges from the 3 counties of Delaware to the 254 counties of Texas.
Counties have significant governmental functions in all states except Rhode Island and Connecticut, where county governments have been abolished but the entities remain for administrative or statistical purposes. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has removed most government functions from eight of its 14 counties.
The county with the largest population, Los Angeles County (10,170,292), and the county with the largest land area (San Bernardino County) border each other in Southern California (however four Boroughs in Alaska are larger in area than San Bernardino).
