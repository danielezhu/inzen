Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday at Newport is a 1958 live album by Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, recorded at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival.
Fitzgerald's first track promoted her recent album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Rodgers & Hart Songbook (1956), and after several teething problems with the microphone, and tempo problems on "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down (And Write Myself a Letter)", she delivers a stunning scat solo on "Air Mail Special", quoting from several recent pop hits.
Holiday is introduced by Johnny Mercer, and Carmen McRae's performance of that year was featured on the 2000 Verve CD reissue.
