"The Meaning Of The Blues" (1957) is a jazz composition and song, with music by Bobby Troup and lyrics by Leah Worth.
This 32-bar piece, despite its title, is structurally not a blues, instead it consists of two 16-bar parts A, A', with a slight dramatic melodic heightening in A'. The melody is minor and remains in the diatonic range, apart from a leading note on the dominant chord in the second to last bar of each part. The piece is usually played as ballad with around 76 bpm or slightly less.
