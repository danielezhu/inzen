A cassette deck is a type of tape machine for playing and recording audio compact cassettes. Consumer electronics formerly used the term deck to distinguish them from a tape recorder, the "deck" being part of a stereo component system, while a "tape recorder" was more portable and usually had a self-contained power amplifier (and often speakers).
Although the two terms became used interchangeably, a recorder is typically thought of as a low-fidelity portable device, while a deck is considered a high fidelity component.
