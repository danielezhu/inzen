Liza May Minnelli ( ; born March 12, 1946) is an American actress and singer. With a career spanning multiple decades, she has been highly successful in multiple fields of entertainment and is among a small group of entertainers who have been honored with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award.
Minnelli is the daughter of film actress and singer Judy Garland and film director Vincente Minnelli. She began her career as a teenager in New York City as a musical theatre actress and nightclub performer. Minnelli also regularly performed with her famous mother, including a 1964 joint engagement at the London Palladium and in Garland's own CBS television series The Judy Garland Show.
In 1965 she made her Broadway debut in the musical Flora the Red Menace and was awarded the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, becoming the youngest ever recipient of the award. Critically lauded for her Academy Award nominated dramatic performance in the film The Sterile Cuckoo (1969), she rose to international stardom with the Emmy Award-winning TV special Liza with a Z (1972) and her performance as Sally Bowles in Cabaret (1972), which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her other film roles have included Golden Globe Award nominated performances in Lucky Lady (1975), New York, New York (1977) and Arthur (1981).
She has successfully returned to the Broadway stage on a number of occasions. She won a Special Tony Award in 1974 for her three-week engagement at the Winter Garden Theatre, won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her starring role in the 1977 musical The Act, was Tony-nominated for her performance for the 1984 musical The Rink, and won the 2009 Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event for her show Liza's at The Palace.
From the late 1970s onwards, Minnelli's work has predominantly focused on concert tours and nightclub performances. She gave highly regarded performances at Carnegie Hall in 1979 and 1987, and at Radio City Music Hall in 1991 and 1992. In the late 1980s she toured alongside Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event.
