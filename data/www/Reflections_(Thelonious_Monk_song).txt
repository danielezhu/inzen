Reflections is a 1952 jazz composition by Thelonious Monk. It has become a jazz standard.
Monk first played "Reflections" in 1952 at a Prestige trio session with "Trinkle Tinkle" and "Bemsha Swing". though the melody of the song received acclaim, it failed to find a lyricist at the time. According to Gary Giddins it is "classic, paradoxical Monk, beautiful and memorable yet a minefield of odd intervals, each essential to its bricks-and-mortar structure". In the 1980s, Jon Hendricks eventually wrote poetic lyrics for the song for Carmen McRae, who released it on her album Carmen Sings Monk. Dianne Reeves sang the tune on her 2003 album A Little Moonlight.
