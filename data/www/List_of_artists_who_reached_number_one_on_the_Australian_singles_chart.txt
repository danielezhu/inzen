This is a list of recording artists who have reached number one on Australia's singles chart from 1956 to the present.
The Beatles hold the record for the most number-ones songs on the Australian charts. Elvis Presley holds the record for the most number-one songs by a male artist, while Madonna holds the record for a female artist.
Artists who reached number one on both the Australian Music Report (AMR) and Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts are included here. The AMR existed until 1999 but ARIA, created in 1989, was recognized as being Australia's official music chart.
All acts are listed alphabetically.
Solo artists are alphabetized by last name, Groups by group name excluding "A", "An", and "The".
Each act's total of number-one singles is shown after their name.
All artists who are mentioned in song credits are listed here; this includes one-time pairings of otherwise solo artists and those appearing as featured (for example both Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden get a credit for "Almost Here", etc.).
Artists associated with a group who reached number one, yet have their own solo page in Wikipedia, are not listed here unless they hit number one as a solo artist.
