How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is a children's story by Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel written in rhymed verse with illustrations by the author. It follows the Grinch, a grouchy, solitary creature who attempts to put an end to Christmas by stealing Christmas-themed items from the homes of the nearby town Whoville on Christmas Eve. Despite his efforts, Whoville's inhabitants still celebrate the holiday, so the Grinch returns everything that he stole and is the guest of honor at the Whos' Christmas dinner. s The story was published as a book by Random House in 1957, and at approximately the same time in an issue of Redbook. The book criticizes the commercialization of Christmas. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named it one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children". In 2012 it was ranked number 61 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by School Library Journal â€“ the fourth of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.
The book was adapted as a Christmas special twice, a 1966 animated TV film starring Boris Karloff as both the narrator and the voice of the Grinch and a 2000 live-action feature film starring Jim Carrey. There will also be a second film adaptation, starring Benedict Cumberbatch scheduled for release on November 9, 2018.
