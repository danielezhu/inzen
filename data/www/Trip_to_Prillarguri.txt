Trip to Prillarguri is a live album by George Russell originally recorded in 1970 and subsequently released on the Italian Soul Note label in 1982, featuring a performance by Russell with Stanton Davis, Jan Garbarek, Terje Rypdal, Arild Andersen, and Jon Christensen. The Allmusic review awarded the album 3 stars, although, as no review text appears to date, this can be considered the default rating for those albums awaiting a review. In all likelihood it will be more of a 4 to 4.5 star album, as it is inventive, invigorating new music with a hint of rock sensibility, and the start of the mature sound of Garbarek, that fully forms in his first ECM album with the Scandinavian musicians on this session.
