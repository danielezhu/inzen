LiveStyle is a Los Angeles-based live events conglomerate founded by media entrepreneur Robert F. X. Sillerman. The company was formed in June 2012 as SFX Entertainmentâ€”the new incarnation of Sillerman's previous company of the same name, which was sold to Clear Channel Communications and later spun-off in 2005 as Live Nation.
The company focuses primarily on live events and other properties relating to electronic music and its associated culture. Its holdings include ownership of various major electronic music promoters and festival brands, such as Tomorrowland, Electric Zoo, and a 50% stake in Rock in Rio among others. The company also owns Beatport, an online electronic music store, and Paylogic, a provider of online ticketing services.
Growing primarily through the acquisitions of various electronic dance music properties, SFX went public on the NASDAQ on October 9, 2013. However, in 2015, the company began to experience financial issues; in August 2015, the company's stock value fell as low as 91 cents. After a failed bid by Sillerman to buy out or sell the company, and a breached preferred investment, SFX filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2016, and Sillerman stepped down as CEO. In December 2016, the company emerged from bankruptcy as a private company, re-named LiveStyle, and with former AEG Live executive Randy Phillips as a new CEO and Charles Ciongoli, formerly of the Universal Music Group as Executive VP & CFO.
