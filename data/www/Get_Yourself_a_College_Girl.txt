Get Yourself a College Girl, also released as The Swinging Set, is a 1964 Metrocolor film comedy in the style of a beach party movie. The plot involves a college co-ed who tries to balance her time writing songs and dealing with her publisher who tries to pursue her. It was directed by Sidney Miller and written by Robert E. Kent, and filmed at Sun Valley, Idaho, United States.
Turner Classic Movies critic Mel Neuhaus calls it "A curious 1964 hybrid of teen movie musical with pre-feminist overtones as well as a parody of moralistic anti-rock message films." It is notable for the appearance of Astrud Gilberto, the Brazilian singer who sang the international hit song "The Girl from Ipanema", appearing as herself in the film.
