Soft rock (or lite rock) is a subgenre of pop music that largely features acoustic guitars and slow-to-mid tempos. Originating in the early 1970s in southern California, the style smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop, relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. Soft rock dominated radio throughout the 1970s and eventually metamorphosed into the synthesized music of adult contemporary in the 1980s.
The term "yacht rock" appeared in the 2000s as a catch-all term for anything "soft" and reminiscent of the 1970s, although not all yacht rock can be characterized as "soft".
