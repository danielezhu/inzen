Lil Hardin Armstrong (February 3, 1898 â€“ August 27, 1971) was a jazz pianist, composer, arranger, singer, and bandleader. She was the second wife of Louis Armstrong, with whom she collaborated on many recordings in the 1920s.
Her compositions include "Struttin' with Some Barbecue", "Don't Jive Me", "Two Deuces", "Knee Drops", "Doin' the Suzie-Q", "Just for a Thrill" (which became a major hit when revived by Ray Charles in 1959), "Clip Joint", and "Bad Boy" (a minor hit for Ringo Starr in 1978). Her composition "Oriental Swing" was heavily sampled to create Parov Stelar's 2012 retro-song "Booty Swing", which in turn gained notoriety when it was used in a 2013 Chevrolet commercial. Armstrong was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014.
Armstrong died on August 27, 1971, but people do not know the cause of her death.
