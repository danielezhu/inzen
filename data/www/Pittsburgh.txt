**Pittsburgh** (/ ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ _**PITS** -burg_) is a city in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny
County. As of 2017, a total population of 305,704 lives within the city
limits, making it the 63rd-largest city in the U.S.[2][5] The metropolitan
population of 2,353,045 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia,
the second-largest in Pennsylvania (behind Philadelphia), and the 26th-largest
in the U.S.

Located at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers,
Pittsburgh is known as both "the Steel City" for its more than 300 steel-
related businesses, and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[6] The
city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclined railways, a pre-revolutionary
fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. The
city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the
mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and
British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[7]

Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum, glass,
shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and
electronics.[8] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New
York and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S.
stockholders per capita.[9] America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area
blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the
longtime Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out.[10] This heritage left
the area with renowned museums, medical centers,[11] parks, research centers,
libraries, a diverse cultural district and the most bars per capita in the
U.S.[12]

Today, Google, Apple, Bosch, Facebook, Uber, Nokia, Autodesk, and IBM are
among 1,600 technology firms generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh
payrolls. The area has served as the long-time federal agency headquarters for
cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear
navy.[13] The area is home to 68 colleges and universities, including research
and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
Pittsburgh.[14] The nation's eighth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies,
and six of the top 300 U.S. law firms make their global headquarters in the
Pittsburgh area, while RAND, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer and NIOSH have
regional bases that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job
growth.[15]

In 2015, Pittsburgh was listed among the "eleven most livable cities in the
world";[16] _The Economist'_ s Global Liveability Ranking placed Pittsburgh as
the first- or second-most livable city in the United States in 2005, 2009,
2011, 2012 and 2014.[17] The region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design, sustainable energy, and energy extraction.[18]

## History[edit]

Pittsburgh

Historical claims

French Empire 1669–1758  
British Empire 1681–1781  
United States 1776–present

Pittsburgh was named in 1758 by General John Forbes, in honor of British
statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. The original pronunciation would
have been /ˈpɪtsbrə, -bərə/ _**PITS** -brə_ or _**PITS** -bə-rə_, matching
similarly named places in Great Britain such as Edinburgh in Scotland and
Aldeburgh in Suffolk.[19] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771
and as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[20] "Be it enacted
by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...by the authority of the same, that the said
town of Pittsburgh shall be...erected into a borough, which shall be called
the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[21]

The current pronunciation, which is extremely unusual in English speaking
countries, is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of
the City Charter of March 18, 1816 (though not on the original document). The
error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century
that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the "h" was removed in
order to make it easier to spell. After a public campaign the original
spelling was officially restored by the United States Board on Geographic
Names in 1911.[21]

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several
other settled groups of Native Americans.[22] The first known European to
enter the region was the French explorer/trader Robert de La Salle from Quebec
during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[23] European pioneers,
primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the
first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that
year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[24]

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to
unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[24] During 1753–54, the
British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove
them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The
French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began
with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was
dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[25]
The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John
Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. Forbes began construction on Fort Pitt,
named after William Pitt the Elder while the settlement was named
"Pittsborough".[26]

During Pontiac's Rebellion, native tribes conducted a siege of Fort Pitt for
two months until Colonel Henry Bouquet relieved it after the Battle of Bushy
Run. Fort Pitt is notable as the site of an early use of smallpox for
biological warfare. Lord Jeffrey Amherst ordered blankets contaminated from
smallpox victims to be distributed in 1763 to the tribes surrounding the fort.
The disease spread into other areas, infected other tribes, and killed
hundreds of thousands.[27][28][ _not in citation given_ ]

During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in
New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds
by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768
Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region
from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of
Pittsburgh".[29] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania
claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed
under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing
Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771 Bedford County, Pennsylvania was
created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian
local government was created as Pitt Township.[30][31] William Teagarden was
the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[32]

Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to
grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the
Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved
by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in
1785. The following year, the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_ was started, and in
1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey
Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797,
glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers
came via routes over the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes.
Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main
base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.

The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American
industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron,
brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government
became a city. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks
immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the
1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny
Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in
1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants and by 1857,
Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly.
Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to
the area.

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and
armament demand. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar
Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the
Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase
production.

In 1901, Carnegie merged several companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910,
Pittsburgh was the nation's 8th-largest city, accounting for between a third
and a half of national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a
half million with European immigration via Ellis Island in New York harbor. By
1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[33] Pittsburgh
also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from
the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[34] Limited
initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled
steel workers.[35] During World War II, demand increased and area mills
operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war
effort.[26] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's
almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of
democracy"[36][37] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation
of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[38]

Following the war, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization
project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The
"Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and
neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the
1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics
industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were
massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[10]

Engineering Center in 2011

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education,
tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high
technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its
economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its
industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a
combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease
in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding
jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the
United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the
Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10%
appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation of the largest 25 MSAs
in the United States, as 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing
values.[39] Pittsburgh's story of economic regeneration was the inspiration of
President Barack Obama to host the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit.[40]

## Geography[edit]

See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity

Pittsburgh has a total area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6
square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) (or 4.75%) is
water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.

The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western
Allegheny Plateau,[41] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle)
sits where the Allegheny River flowing from the northeast and Monongahela
River from the southeast form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point
State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include
the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum
and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions.
The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily
residential.

Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mt. Washington

Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More
than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or
similar features.[a]

The steps of Pittsburgh comprise some 712 sets of outdoor public stairways
with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets
composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for
sidewalks.[42] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting
hikers and fitness walkers.[43]

Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers
and hollows, but steep hills and variable weather can make biking a challenge.
The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the
city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles (539 km) away) with
a continuous bike/running trail.

Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods

The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[44] and
four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into
distinct neighborhoods (in total, Pittsburgh contains 90 neighborhoods).[45]
Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the North Side, South
Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.

##### Golden Triangle[edit]

Downtown Pittsburgh from Station Square

Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m).
U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[46] The Cultural District
comprises a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. It is packed
with theaters and arts venues, and has a growing residential segment. Most
significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a
four-block mixed-use "green" community, featuring 700 residential units and
multiple towers between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of downtown
borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and is home to the
distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers
have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential
use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's
subway and multiple bridges leading north and south.[47] It is also home to
Point Park University, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne
University which borders Uptown.

##### North Side[edit]

Further information: North Side (Pittsburgh)

The North Side

The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known
today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and
operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh. Allegheny City merged with
Pittsburgh under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily
composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for well-constructed
and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th
century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative
woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also
home to many popular attractions such as Heinz Field, PNC Park, Carnegie
Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory
installation art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Highmark
SportsWorks, Penn Brewery, and Allegheny Observatory. The North Side is also
home to Allegheny General Hospital, which is listed among the 1999 _US News &
World Report_ 2000 best hospitals nationwide.

##### South Side[edit]

Further information: South Side (Pittsburgh)

The South Side was once the site of the Pennsylvania Railroad railyards and
associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the
late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation
with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and
landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The
area has become a local Pittsburgher destination. The South Side is one of the
most popular neighborhoods in the city in which to own a home. The value of
homes in the South Side has increased in value by about 10% annually for the
past 10 years.[48] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant
areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant
nightlife, and live music venues.

In 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South
Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various
developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a
riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor
practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction
began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many
stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle
Outfitters.[49]

##### East End[edit]

The Shadyside neighborhood

The East End is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon
University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's
Museums of Art and Natural History, Frick Art & Historical Center (Clayton and
the Frick art museum), Phipps Conservatory, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside
and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and
condos. They enjoy pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Oakland,
heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of
the universities, Schenley Park and the Petersen Events Center. Bloomfield is
Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and
grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with
artists and designers; it is expected to benefit from the recent new
construction of a new Children's Hospital. The Strip District to the west
along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing
destination by night.

##### West End[edit]

Further information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region

The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the Downtown
skyline and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and
Elliott.

#### Ethnicities[edit]

Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain an ethnic character
reflecting the city's immigrant history. These include:

  * _German_ : Troy Hill, Mt. Washington, and East Allegheny (Deutschtown)
  * _Italian_ : Brookline, Bloomfield, Morningside, Oakland
  * _Hispanic/Latino_ : Beechview/Brookline
  * _Polish, Austrian, Belgian, Czech, Slovakian, German, Hungarian, Luxembourgish, Dutch, Romanian, Swiss, Slovenia and the northern marginal regions of Italy, Croatian, as well as northeastern France, Central European_ : South Side, Lawrenceville, and Polish Hill
  * _Lithuanian_ : South Side, Uptown
  * _African American/Multiracial African American_ : Hill District, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, and Hazelwood
  * _Jewish_ (Ashkenazi): Squirrel Hill

####  Population densities[edit]

Several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less urban, featuring tree-
lined streets, yards and garages, with a more suburban character. Oakland, the
South Side, the North Side, and the Golden Triangle are characterized by more
density of housing, walking neighborhoods, and a more diverse, urban feel.

### Regional identity[edit]

Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as
defined by multiple US Government agencies, but the Pittsburgh Combined
Statistical Area extends into both the Southern United States (West Virginia)
and the Midwestern United States (Ohio), with the borders of the three regions
meeting 30 miles (48 km) from the city. Pittsburgh is also in the Great Lakes
Megalopolis, a collection of primarily Midwestern and nearby Canadian cities,
reflecting Pittsburgh's socio-economic connections to Ohio and points
west.[50][51]

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the
Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the
"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[52] In its post-industrial
state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of
Appalachia",[53][54][55][56] recognizing the city's cultural, educational,
healthcare, and technological resources, as well as its status as Appalachia's
largest city.

### Climate[edit]

Pittsburgh lies in the humid continental climate zone (Köppen _Dfa_ ).[57] The
city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher
elevated areas lie in zone 6a.[58] The area has four distinct seasons: winters
are cold, cloudy, and moderately snowy, springs and falls generally mild with
moderate levels of sunshine, and summers warm to hot and humid. As measured by
percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[59]

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of
72.6 °F (22.6 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs
reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[60] a considerable heat
index arises. The coldest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.4
°F (−2.0 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average
2.6 nights per year.[60] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F
(−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times,
most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19
°C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record
low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July
1, 1901.[60][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the
Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last
seen on July 15, 1995.[60]

Average annual precipitation is 38.2 inches (970 mm) and total precipitation
is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has
historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.41 in (1,458 mm) in
2004.[61] On average, December and January have the greatest number of
precipitation days. Snowfall averages 41.4 inches (105 cm) per season, but has
historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 82.0 in (208 cm) in
1950–51.[62] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days
per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[63] In terms of annual percent-average
possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (43%).[64]

#### Air and water quality[edit]

"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this
county...We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade
and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more."

“

Guillermo Cole

In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American
Lung Association (ALA) ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher
amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas
having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For
ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro
areas.[66][67] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey.
The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health
Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air
quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging.
The lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S.
Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several
municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading
to possible confusion that Pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the
emissions cited in the survey.[68] The region's readings also reflect
pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia, though both are outside the
jurisdictional powers of local leadership.[69]

Although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed
substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure.
Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10
between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[70]
ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated that "It's the best it's been in the
lifetime for virtually every resident in this county...We've seen a steady
decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past
20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more."[71]

The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits;
however, fish catches in the city in 2007 were found to be more than twice as
free of pollutants than catches on the Canadian side of Lake Erie and six
times as free of pollutants than Allegheny River catches of the New York
border area.[72] There are other concerns about local storm sewers and waste
treatment plants frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways,
due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure.

The city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count
conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's total tree cover, which
involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a
value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the "urban
forest" contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy
savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in
property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends
$850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[73]

## Economy[edit]

Pittsburgh skyline from Mount Washington

Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and
electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics,
health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance,
education, and services. Total annual payroll of the region's technology
industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[92] and
in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[93] A National Bureau of
Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for
intergenerational economic mobility[94] or the American Dream.[95] Reflecting
the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been
renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices
in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery
Square.[96] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough
mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[97]
Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as
"the poster child for managing industrial transition".[98] Other major cities
in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's
model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[99]

Pittsburgh is the poster child for managing industrial transition.

The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's
office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in
the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: "That's
both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the
steel industry represented in the 1970s."[100]

Pittsburgh has a rich history in arts and culture dating from 19th century
industrialists commissioning and donating public works, such as Heinz Hall for
the Performing Arts and the Benedum Center, home to the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera, respectively as well as such groups as the
River City Brass Band and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra.

Pittsburgh has a long tradition of jazz, blues, and bluegrass music. The
National Negro Opera Company was founded in the city as the first all African-
American opera company in the United States. This led to the prominence of
African-American singers like Leontyne Price in the world of opera. Pittsburgh
has a number of small and mid-size arts organizations including the Pittsburgh
Irish and Classical Theatre, Quantum Theatre, the Renaissance and Baroque
Society of Pittsburgh, and the early music ensemble Chatham Baroque. Several
choirs and singing groups are also present at the cities' universities; some
of the most notable include the Pitt Men's Glee Club and the Heinz Chapel

the city and are celebrated by the world-famous Duquesne University
Tamburitzans, a multicultural academy dedicated to the preservation and
presentation of folk songs and dance.

Hundreds of major films have been shot partially or wholly in Pittsburgh. _The
Dark Knight Rises_ was largely filmed in Downtown, Oakland, and the North
Shore. Pittsburgh has also teamed up with a Los Angeles-based production
company, and has built the largest and most advanced movie studio in the
eastern United States.[107]

Pittsburgh's major art museums include the Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie
Museum of Art, the Frick Art & Historical Center, Pittsburgh Center for the

anthem "Black and Yellow" (a tribute to Pittsburgh's official colors) reached
number one on Billboard's "Hot 100"[111] for the Week of February 19,
2011[112] Not since Grammy-winning blues guitarist George Benson has a
Pittsburgh artist received such national acclaim. Perry Como and Christina
Aguilera are from Pittsburgh suburbs. Hip hop artist Mac Miller's album _Blue
Slide Park_ debuted at the top of Billboard's album chart; its first #1
independent release since _Dogg Food_ in 1995.[113]

Many punk rock and Hardcore punk acts, such as Aus Rotten and Anti-Flag,
originated in Pittsburgh.

### Theatre[edit]

Benedum Center

Main article: Theatre in Pittsburgh

The city's first play was produced at the old courthouse in 1803[115] and the
first theater built in 1812.[116] Collegiate companies include the University
of Pittsburgh's Repertory Theatre and Kuntu Repertory Theatre, Point Park
University's resident companies at its Pittsburgh Playhouse, and Carnegie
Mellon University's School of Drama productions and Scotch'n'Soda
organization. The Duquesne University Red Masquers, founded in 1912, are the
oldest, continuously producing theater company in Pennsylvania.[ _citation
needed_ ] The city's longest-running theater show, Friday Nite Improvs, is an
improv jam that has been performed in the Cathedral of Learning and other
locations for 20 years. The Pittsburgh New Works Festival utilizes local
theatre companies to stage productions of original one-act plays by
playwrights from all parts of the country. Similarly, Future Ten showcases new
ten-minute plays. Saint Vincent Summer Theatre, Off the Wall Productions,
Mountain Playhouse, The Theatre Factory, and Stage Right! in nearby Latrobe,

Pittsburgh is the birthplace of Gertrude Stein and Rachel Carson, a Chatham
University graduate from the suburb of Springdale, Pennsylvania.[117] Modern
writers include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson and Michael
Chabon with his Pittsburgh-focused commentary on student and college life.
Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, David McCullough was born and raised in Pittsburgh.[118] Annie
Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh.
Much of her memoir An American Childhood takes place in post-World War II
Pittsburgh. John Edgar Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and based "Brothers and
Keepers," a National Book Critics awarded novel in his hometown. Poet Terrance
Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation
Fellow, received his MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, where he is
currently a faculty member. Poet Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press,
currently resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet
Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
also resides in the city. New writers include Chris Kuzneski who attended the
University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his works and Pittsburgher
Brian Celio, author of _Catapult Soul_ who captured the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer'
dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to
playwrights,[119] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists.

There are also specific Pittsburgh genres that have been adopted in globally,
from children's television to sci-fi/fantasy to Yinzer Pittsburghese.

Pittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and
networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres
exemplified by _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_ , _Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego?_ , _Happy's Party_ , _Cappelli& Company_ , and _The Children's
Corner_ , all nationally broadcast.

The _Pittsburgh Dad_ series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global
YouTube audience since 2011.

The modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by
director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his _Chiller
Theatre_ ,[120] director and writer Rusty Cundieff[121] and makeup effects
guru Tom Savini.[122] The genre continues today with the PARSEC writers
organization,[123] The It's Alive Show, the annual "Zombie Fest",[124] and
several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[125] Pittsburgh
SouthWrites,[126] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[127][128] with Barton Paul
Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose.

### Local dialect[edit]

Main article: Western Pennsylvania English

The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called _Pittsburghese_ , was
influenced by Scots-Irish, Welsh, German, Central European, and Eastern
European immigrants.[ _citation needed_ ] Locals who speak the dialect are
sometimes referred to as "Yinzers" (from the local word "yinz" [var. _yunz_ ],
a blended form of "you ones," similar to "y'all" and "you all" in the South).
Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy (slippery), redd up (clean up), jagger
bush (thorn bush), and gum bands (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable
for dropping the verb "to be." In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs
washed" instead of "needs to be washed," "needs washing," or "needs a wash."
The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of
Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The
staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh
or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted _The
New York Times_ to describe Pittsburgh as, "the Galapagos Islands of American
dialect."[129] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other
European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[130]

###  Livability[edit]

Pittsburgh from the West End Overlook

Pittsburgh often places high in lists of the nation's most livable cities.
After placing fourth and first in the first two editions of _Places Rated
Almanac_ , Pittsburgh finished third in 1989, fifth in 1993, 14th in 1997, and
12th in 2000, before reclaiming the number one spot in 2007.[131] The survey's
primary author, David Savageau, has noted that Pittsburgh is the only city to
finish in the top 20 of every edition.

In 2005, 2009, and 2011, Pittsburgh was named the most livable city in the
United States and in those years, between the 26th- and 29th-most livable
cities worldwide by _The Economist_.[132][133] Pittsburgh ranked No. 28 in the
book _Cities Ranked and Rated_ (2004) by Bert Sperling and Peter Sander.

In 2010, _Forbes_ and _Yahoo!_ listed Pittsburgh as the most livable city in
the United States.[134][135] A month later, _Forbes_ named Pittsburgh the 7th
best place to raise a family.[136] Pittsburgh was ranked the 4th best city for
working mothers by Forbes in 2010[137] and the city was ranked as one of the
best for entrepreneurs by _Entrepreneur_.[138] _Forbes_ named Pittsburgh, in
an 8-way tie, the world's 10th cleanest city for 2007.[139]

The _Economist Intelligence Unit_ named Pittsburgh the top place to live in
the United States in 2011,[140] and behind only Honolulu for 2012 and
2014.[141][142]

The city was listed among the 10 best U.S. places to retire in 2012 by _CBS
Money Watch_ and _U.S. News_.[143][144] In February 2013 _Forbes_ again placed
Pittsburgh among its 10 most unexpectedly romantic world locations.[145] In
April 2014, Niche rated Pittsburgh the 15th best city for millennials.[146]

Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, crime,
and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living compared to
other northeastern U.S. cities. According to the Federal Housing Board the
average price for a 3- to 4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh for 2004
is $162,000, well below the national average of $264,540. Average 2010 rent
for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh was $789. This compares to the nationwide
average of $1,087.[147] Pittsburgh also has five city parks and several parks
managed by the Nature Conservancy, the largest of which, Frick Park, provides
a 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive hiking and biking trails
throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding enthusiasts love to visit
Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where well over 100 species of birds have
been recorded.[148]

Enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is that the area faces little natural
disaster risk such as an earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. _Forbes_
ranked Pittsburgh as having the 2nd lowest natural disaster risk in the nation
for 2009.[149] Greater Pittsburgh is not entirely free of natural disasters,
however. Residents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one
of the 1,400 creeks and streams experience occasional floods,[150] such as
those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in
2004.[151] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control
efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[150][152][153]
Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from
occasional flooding, and the cost of a comprehensive flood control program for
the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[150]

Pittsburgh has the most bars per capita in the nation.[12]

## Sports[edit]

Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World
Series. The city boasts several professional teams and in 2009 the city has
won the _Sporting News_ title of "Best Sports City" in the United States.[154]
and _Sperling's Best Places_ "top 15 cities for baseball" in 2013.[155]
College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in
football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and
Duquesne.

Pittsburgh's dedication to sports has a long history with its major
professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the
Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League
Baseball[156]—share the same team colors, the official city colors of black
and gold. This tradition of solidarity is unique to Pittsburgh. The black-and-
gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and
personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[157]

"Rails to Trails", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational
trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail. Several
mountain biking trails are located within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has
biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[

### Baseball[edit]

PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates

[t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and
baseball…The best stadium in baseball is in Pittsburgh.

“

”

ESPN

The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the
Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports
franchise having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of
the National League. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time
World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two
pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park,
annually ranked as one of the sports best venues; ESPN.com stated: "[t]his is
the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball…The best
stadium in baseball is in Pittsburgh."[158] PNC Park hosted the team's MLB
record-tying fifth All-Star game in 2006.

Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro League history, with the former Pittsburgh
Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles
and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones
fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first
Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed,
"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh."[159]

Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League
Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each),
followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with
20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason
appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild
Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last
no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[160]

Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Panthers
(football)

Heinz Field seen from above

Football is the most popular and tradition laden sport in the region. The
nation's first professional game was played in the city on November 12, 1892,
between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club,
the first pro-team in nearby Latrobe and first organized league, the NFL and
their inaugural champions: the Pittsburgh Stars. [ _citation needed_ ]

The city's most popular team is the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, named after the
distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News
of the team has preempted news of elections and other events, and are
important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the
Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching
(only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and
are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[ _citation needed_ ]
The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out
every home game since 1972.[161] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year
span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super
Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the
most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most
NFL conference championship games.[ _citation needed_ ]

High school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive
press coverage.[ _citation needed_ ] The Tom Cruise film _All the Right Moves_
and ESPN's _Bound for Glory_ with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to
capture the tradition and passion of local high school football.

College football in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers
of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and
recently [ _when?_ ] qualifying for seven straight bowl games for 31 total.
Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow
their lower (FCS) teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University, and Washington
& Jefferson College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the
1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.[ _citation
needed_ ]

Heinz Field serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban
and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and
Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and
2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing
in two total, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the
Storm.[162] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's
football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed
Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the
mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier.

The NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's
founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992,
2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009,
2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario
Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena
in 2010 (when it known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home
games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in
local parlance "The Igloo".[163]

Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The
city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the
Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the
Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor
skating.[164]

The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the
strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow
Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The
NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with a future
Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey
survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven
finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons.

Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island
Sports Center. Pittsburgh is a hotbed for semi-pro and amateur teams such as
the top 50 ranked Junior Penguins, Predators and Viper Stars, with the Hornets
a top 20 team for the last 7 years.[ _citation needed_ ] Pro-grade ice rinks
such as the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe have trained
several native Pittsburgh players for NHL play. RMU hosted the city's first
Frozen Four college championship in 2013 with the four PPG Paints Arena games
televised by ESPN.

### Basketball[edit]

Professional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams
"Monticello" and "Loendi" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937–45
in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947–48 NBA inaugural season), the
Pittsburgh Rens (1961–63), the Pittsburgh Condors (first American Basketball
Association championship in 1968 and playing until 1972), the Pittsburgh
Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004–08) and Phantoms
(2009–10) both of the ABA. The city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15
regular season "neutral site" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record
setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage
on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[165]

Petersen Events Center, home of Pittsburgh Panthers basketball

Palumbo Center, home of Duquesne Dukes basketball

The Duquesne University Dukes and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers have
played college basketball in the city since 1914 and 1905 respectively. Pitt
and Duquesne have played the annual City Game since 1932. Duquesne was the
city's first team to appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP
Poll ranking (1954),[166] and to win a post-season national title, the 1955
National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title
game. Duquesne is the only college program to produce back-to-back NBA #1
overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green.[
_citation needed_ ] Duquesne's Chuck Cooper was the first African American
drafted by an NBA team.[167]

The Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National
Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a "national title game" against
LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13
conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 25 times including a post
season tournament every season since 1999–2000 and regularly sells out the
Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All
Americans while ranking #1 in the nation as recently as 2009.

The suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA
Division I basketball since the 1970s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament in
each of the last four decades (8 total). In the 2013 National Invitation
Tournament the Colonials notched an upset win over the defending national
champions Kentucky Wildcats.

Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season
tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans
selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before
being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have
competitive Division I women's basketball programs.

Pittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game in 1965.[
_citation needed_ ] The Roundball Classic annually featured future NBA hall of
famers at the Civic Arena with ESPN televising. The Civic Arena also hosted
the Championship Tournament for the Eastern Eight Conference from 1978 until
1982.

## Government and politics[edit]

### Government[edit]

Main article: Government of Pittsburgh

The Pittsburgh City-County Building, the seat of government of the City of
Pittsburgh.

The Government of Pittsburgh is composed of the Mayor of Pittsburgh, the
Pittsburgh City Council, and various boards and commissions. The mayor and the
nine-member council serve a four-year term. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief
of Staff has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning, and as a
"gatekeeper" to the mayor. City council members are chosen by plurality
elections in each of nine districts. The government's official offices are
located in the Pittsburgh City-County Building.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court holds sessions in Pittsburgh, as well as
Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania
General Assembly by three Senate Districts and nine House Districts.
Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 14th congressional district.

### Politics[edit]

In 2006, Council President Luke Ravenstahl was sworn in as mayor at age 26,
becoming the youngest mayor in the history of any major American city. His
successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in January 6, 2014. Current Pittsburgh City
Council members are: Darlene Harris, Theresa Kail-Smith, Natalia Rudiak, Cory
O'Conner, R. Daniel Lavelle, Deborah Gross, Dan Gilman, and Rev. Ricky
Burgess. They are elected from single-member districts.[168] The president of
city council is Bruce Kraus.

Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is
considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[ _citation needed_
] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil
War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the
Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a
shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973
and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket),
Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933
election. The city's current ratio of party registration is 5 to 1
Democrat.[169]

Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate
Districts (Randy Vulakovich (R)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa
(D)-43) and nine House Districts (Jake Wheatley-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Dom
Costa-21, Dan Frankel-23, Ed Gainey-24, Dan Deasy-27, Paul Costa-34, and Harry
Readshaw-36, Dan Miller-42).

Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 14th congressional district,
represented by Democrat Michael F. Doyle since 1995.

### Law enforcement[edit]

Police

The area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,
with close to 1,000 sworn officers. The city also has separate housing and
school police departments. Other agencies also provide police protection
within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The
Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The
Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports,
while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the
Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B
provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs.

The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District
Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads
forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for
Western Pennsylvania.

### Crime[edit]

Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being
named the 3rd "most secure" big city by Farmers Insurance.[170] Among crime
rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime
while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime
were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI
recommends against using data for ranking.[171][172] Per 100,000 persons stats
(2012):

| Murder | Rape | Robbery | Assault | Burglary | Theft | Motor Vehicle |
**Total Violent** | **Total Property**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
City |  13.1 | 15.1 | 363.3 | 360.4 | 812.8 | 2,438.2 | 174.3 | 752.0 |
3,425.4  
  
At the end of 2016, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 59 murders in the
city, marking "one of the most violent years in recent history."[173]

## Health care[edit]

See also: List of hospitals in Pittsburgh

UPMC's flagship, UPMC Presbyterian

The two largest area health care providers are the world-renowned University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network
(since 1882). Both flagship hospitals annually rank as among the best overall
in the United States, with UPMC being among _U.S. News and World Report's_
"Honor Roll" every year since 2000.

The first military hospital in U.S. history as well as the first west of the
Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to
1845.[189] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy
Hospital".[190] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant
Hospital in 1849,[191] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in
1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954,
Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[192]

Allegheny General, the flagship of WPAHS

In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($825 million today) expansion and also
hired transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl.[193] In 1984, Allegheny General
surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Dr. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver
transplant of 5 year old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor
University, starting its transplant program.[194] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons
Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung
transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($503 million today)
modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by
the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the
world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species
marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[195] UPMC's
Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a
world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[196]

The $80 million ($111 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the
Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened
its $30 million ($40.6 million today), 5 floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer
center. The $130 million ($173 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer
Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($533
million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health
information systems.

In 2009, the $600 million ($667 million today) Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh of UPMC opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for
several unique approaches to patient care.[197] UPMC officially adopted in
Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins
announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[198] UPMC
announced in 2013 that it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help
found its medical school.[199]

### Health discoveries[edit]

UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic
fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver
and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984),
the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first
heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant
on an infant (1997),[200] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver
transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the
first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first
heart transplant (1968).[201][202]

Children's Hospital

_The Lancet_ published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9 year quadriplegics being
able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and
even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle
function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer
to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[203]

##  Transportation[edit]

At least 17 of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo

Main article: Transportation in Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With a total of 446,[204] it has three
bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City
of Bridges."[205] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The
Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The
city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the
North. The south-western "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from
Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort
Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying
Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Heinz Field
and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries the Port Authority's
Blue/Red/Brown subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L
Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit
connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000
bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[206]

### Rail[edit]

Penn Station was built in 1903

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first
opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore & Ohio
Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the
Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until
1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight
services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George
Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since
1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight
corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through
the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard—originally built in 1889—was the
largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the
nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern
U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh.

Amtrak provides intercity rail service via the _Capitol Limited_ and the
_Pennsylvanian_ which use Penn Station.

###  Port[edit]

The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st-largest port in the United States
with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked
9th-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[207]

### Expressways and highways[edit]

Expressways | Other Highways  
---|---  
| Parkway North |  | US 19 |  PA 88  
  
| Parkway East & West |  
| Truck  
US 19 |  PA 121  
| Crosstown |  | PA 8 |  PA 130  
| Route 28 |  | PA 50 |  PA 380  
| Route 65 |  | PA 51 |  PA 837  
  |   |  | PA 60 |  PA 885  
  
I-279

Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the
"parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate
76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79,
the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and
Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The
"crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the
Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long
expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry
traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively.
Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped
"beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and
southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway,
Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway
Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.

The city announced plans to make several improvements to the expressways and
highways in 2017:

  * Interstate 279/Parkway North will have emergency pull-offs and crossover areas constructed in both directions; $87.9 million project[208]
  * Interstate 376 will undergo median crossover work; $66.3 million project[208]
  * Interstate 79 will be repaved; $16.7 million project[208]
  * Route 65 will have improvements such as concrete patching, an asphalt overlay, bridge reconstruction, base repairs, drainage and guide rail updates, new signs, retaining wall repairs and pavement-marking installation; $25.3 million project[208]

### Airports[edit]

Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports

Pittsburgh International Airport and Arnold Palmer Regional Airport provide
commercial passenger service to the metropolitan area.

### Public transit[edit]

The Steel Plaza subway station

Port Authority of Allegheny County, commonly known as the Port Authority, but
sometimes referred to by its former nickname "PAT" or "PAT Transit", is the
region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh
area (the nation's 20th largest metro area), it is the 11th largest transit
agency in the nation and helped the region rank 8th on commuters that use non-
car means to work, second to only Chicago in metros outside the Northeast
corridor.[209] Port Authority runs a network of intracity and intercity bus
routes, the Monongahela Incline funicular railway (more commonly known as an
"incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-
ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the
nation's largest busway systems.[210] The Duquesne Incline is operated by a
non-profit preservation trust,[211] but accepts Port Authority passes and
charges Port Authority fares.
