A provost is the senior academic administrator at many institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada, the equivalent of a pro-vice-chancellor at some institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland or a Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) at most Australian universities.
Additionally, the heads of certain colleges in the UK and Ireland are called provosts and it is, in this sense, the equivalent of a master at other colleges.
