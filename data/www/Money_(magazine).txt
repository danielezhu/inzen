Money is a magazine that is published by Time Inc. Its first issue was published in October 1972. Its articles cover the gamut of personal finance topics ranging from investing, saving, retirement and taxes to family finance issues like paying for college, credit, career and home improvement. It is well known for its annual list of "America's Best Places to Live." The magazine, along with Fortune, was a partner with sister cable network CNN in CNNMoney.com, an arrangement made after the discontinuation of the CNNfn business news channel in 2004. In 2014, following the spin-off of Time Inc., the magazine's publisher, from CNN parent Time Warner, Money launched its own website, Money.com.
