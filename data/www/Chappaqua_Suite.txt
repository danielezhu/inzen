Chappaqua Suite is a free jazz album that was recorded and released in 1965, by alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman. It was originally commissioned by actor/director Conrad Rooks as the soundtrack to his film Chappaqua; however, the music was not used in the released version of the film. According to the album's liner notes, Rooks decided upon hearing Coleman's music that he found it was so beautiful that he feared it would overpower the imagery and action of the film. Instead, Columbia Records released it as a double album, but gave it very little promotion and the album sold poorly. It was taken out of print the following year and has since come back into print intermittently and in very small editions.
Chappaqua Suite was Coleman's first studio recording with a trio featuring David Izenzon on bass and Charles Moffett on drums. It was also his first recording with a full orchestra, in this case a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Joseph Tekula. Coleman's suite is four parts, each occupying a full record side. Tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders appears on the fourth part of the suite.
