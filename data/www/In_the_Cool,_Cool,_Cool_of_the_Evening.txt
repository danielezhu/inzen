"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening" is a popular song with music by Hoagy Carmichael and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It was originally planned to feature it in a Paramount picture which was written for Betty Hutton that never took off. That projected film was to be called The Mack Sennett Girl (aka Keystone Girl). The song was buried in Paramount's files until it was rediscovered and then used in the 1951 film, Here Comes the Groom, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.
The recording by Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman was recorded on June 20, 1951 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27678. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on September 21, 1951, and lasted six weeks on the chart, peaking at number 11.
