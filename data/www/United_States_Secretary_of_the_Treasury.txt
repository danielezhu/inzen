The **Secretary of the Treasury** is the head of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury[4] which is concerned with financial and monetary matters, and, until
2003, also included several federal law enforcement agencies. This position in
the federal government of the United States is analogous to the Minister of
Finance in many other countries. The Secretary of the Treasury is a member of
the President's Cabinet, and is nominated by the President of the United
States. Nominees for Secretary of the Treasury undergo a confirmation hearing
before the United States Senate Committee on Finance before being voted on by
the United States Senate.

The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General,
and the Secretary of Defense are generally regarded as the four most important
cabinet officials because of the importance of their departments.[5] The
Secretary of the Treasury is a non-statutory member of the U.S. National
Security Council and fifth in the United States presidential line of
succession.
