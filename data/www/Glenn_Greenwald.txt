Glenn Edward Greenwald (born March 6, 1967) is an American journalist and author, best known for his role in a series of reports published by The Guardian newspaper beginning in June 2013, detailing United States and British global surveillance programs, and based on classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden. Greenwald and the team he worked with won both a George Polk Award and a Pulitzer Prize for those reports. He has written several best-selling books, including No Place to Hide.
Before the Snowden file disclosures, Greenwald was widely considered one of the most influential opinion columnists in the United States. After working as a constitutional lawyer for 10 years, he began blogging on national security issues before becoming a Salon contributor in 2007 and then moving to The Guardian in 2012. He currently writes for and co-edits The Intercept, which he founded in 2013 with Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill.
