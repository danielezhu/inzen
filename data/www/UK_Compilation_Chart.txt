The UK Compilation Chart is a record chart based on sales of multi artist compilation albums in the United Kingdom. It is compiled weekly by the Official Charts Company (OCC), and each week's Top 40 is published online on the official websites of the OCC (Top 100), BBC Radio 1 and MTV, and in the magazines Music Week (Top 20) and UKChartsPlus (Top 50).
Though only accredited to compiling multi-artist compilation albums, the chart compiles all full-length various artist releases, regardless of whether they are compilations or studio albums where all the recordings are new (such as The Help Album in 1995 or Radio 1 Established 1967 in 2007).
