LIVE365 is an Internet radio broadcasting and listening network where users are able to create their own online radio stations, or choose to listen to thousands of human curated stations created by people from around the globe. LIVE365 is unique in that online radio stations on the LIVE365 network were created and managed by music and talk enthusiasts, including both hobbyists and professional broadcasters. LIVE365 also has many well established AM and FM stations that utilized the LIVE365 broadcasting platform to simulcast their terrestrial radio streams via the Live365 distribution network. The Live365 network also features radio stations from well-known artists such as Johnny Cash, David Byrne, Pat Metheny, Jethro Tull, Frank Zappa, and more. LIVE365 was created in 1999, and remains one of the longest running internet radio websites for listeners and broadcasters.
With the pending expiration of the lower royalty rate allowed for small broadcasters, investors removed their support of the company. In late December, 2015, LIVE365 laid off most of its employees and vacated its office, and the few remaining employees were working from home. On January 31, 2016 LIVE365 ceased webcasting. LIVE365's website now redirects listeners and users to a list of competing services. The shutdown of LIVE365 also affected terrestrial AM and FM stations that used LIVE365, causing them to disperse to other live streams. Nearly a year to the day after its closure, LIVE365 has relaunched its site and streaming services.
