The Q Awards are the UK's annual music awards run by the music magazine Q. Since they began in 1990, the Q Awards have become one of Britain's biggest and best publicised music awards. Locations for the awards ceremony include Abbey Road Studios and, more recently, The Park Lane Ballroom.
One of the more notable events of the awards was the ceremony of 2004, at which Elton John accused Madonna of cheating fans by miming on stage, after she had been nominated for a Best Live Act award. The 2001 event, was somewhat notoriously notable for Phil Jupitus stretching out the time it took to announce the "Best Producer" award, with him exclaiming "Best Producer?.... 'Would you like a cowbell in that?'", before being told off camera to get on with announcing the winner.
The Q Awards have included many awards recognising a lifetime of achievement, rather than achievements over the year in question. In recent years, the 'lifetime' awards have usually outnumbered the 'current' awards.
