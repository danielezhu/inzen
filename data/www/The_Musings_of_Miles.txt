The Musings of Miles is the first 12" LP by Miles Davis, issued by Prestige Records in 1955, following several LPs in the discontinued 10 inch format. The six tracks were all recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's home studio, June 7, 1955. The rhythm section of this quartet is the nucleus of the group that later became known as Miles' First Great Quintet. The First Great Quintet would record in the same year.
"A Night in Tunisia" features Philly Joe Jones playing with special drum sticks which had bells riveted to the shaft.
