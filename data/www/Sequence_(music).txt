In music, a sequence is the restatement of a motif or longer melodic (or harmonic) passage at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice. It is one of the most common and simple methods of elaborating a melody in eighteenth and nineteenth century classical music (Classical period and Romantic music). Characteristics of sequences:
Two segments, usually no more than three or four
Usually only one direction: continuingly higher or lower
Segments continue by same interval distance
It is possible for melody or harmony to form a sequence without the other participating.

There are many types of sequences, each with a unique pattern. Listed below are some examples.
