The Star-Ledger is the largest circulated newspaper in the U.S. state of New Jersey and is based in Newark. It is a sister paper to The Jersey Journal of Jersey City, The Times of Trenton and the Staten Island Advance, all of which are owned by Advance Publications.
In 2007, The Star-Ledger's daily circulation was reportedly more than the next two largest New Jersey newspapers combined and its Sunday circulation larger than the next three papers combined. It has suffered great declines in print circulation in recent years, to 180,000 daily in 2013 and 114,000 "individually paid print circulation," that is the number of copies being bought by subscription or at newsstands, in 2015.
In July 2013, The Ledger announced that it would sell its headquarters building in Newark. In 2013, Advance Publications announced it was exploring cost-saving changes among its New Jersey properties, but was not considering mergers or changes in publication frequency at any of the newspapers, nor the elimination of home delivery.
