Timpani (; Italian pronunciation: [Ëˆtimpani]) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. Most modern timpani drums, such as pedal timpani are able to, and are designed to be, tuned easily to specific pitches, often during sections of music; the example being tuned by a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drumstick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock.
Timpani is an Italian plural, the singular of which is timpano. However, in English a single instrument is rarely called a timpano: several are more typically referred to collectively as kettledrums, timpani, temple drums, timp-toms, or timps. They are also often incorrectly termed timpanis. A musician who plays the timpani is a timpanist.
