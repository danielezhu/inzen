The ride cymbal is a standard cymbal in most drum kits. It maintains a steady rhythmic pattern, sometimes called a ride pattern, rather than the accent of a crash. It is normally placed on the extreme right (or dominant hand) of a drum set, above the floor tom.
The ride can fulfill any function or rhythm the hi-hat does, with the exception of an open and closed sound.
The ride is played with a drumstick.
