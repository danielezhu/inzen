A demonym (; δῆμος dẽmos "people, tribe", ὄνομα ónoma "name") is a word that identifies residents or natives of a particular place, which is derived from the name of that particular place. It is a neologism (i.e., a recently minted term); previously gentilic was recorded in English dictionaries, e.g., the Oxford English Dictionary and Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary.
Examples of demonyms include a Pakistani for a person from Pakistan, Swahili for a person of the Swahili coast, the colloquial Kiwi for a person from New Zealand and a Cochabambino for a person from the city of Cochabamba.
Demonyms do not always clearly distinguish place of origin or ethnicity from place of residence or citizenship, and many demonyms overlap with the ethnonym for the ethnically dominant group of a region. Thus a Thai may be any resident or citizen of Thailand, of any ethnic group, or more narrowly a member of the Thai people. Conversely, some groups of people may be associated with multiple demonyms. For example, a native of the United Kingdom may be called a British person, a Briton or, informally, a Brit. In some languages, when a parallel demonym does not exist, a demonym is borrowed from another language as a nickname or descriptive adjective of a group of people.
In English, demonyms are capitalized and are often the same as the adjectival form of the place, e.g. Egyptian, Japanese, or Greek. Significant exceptions exist; for instance the adjectival form of Spain is "Spanish", but the demonym is "Spaniard".
English widely includes country-level demonyms such as Ethiopian or Guatemalan and more local demonyms such as Wisconsinite, Chicagoan, Michigander, "Fluminense", and "Paulista". Some places lack a commonly used and accepted demonym. This poses a particular challenge to those toponymists who research demonyms.
