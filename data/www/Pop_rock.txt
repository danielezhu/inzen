Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock) is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo-wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. It may be viewed as one genre field, rather than two distinct categories. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.
