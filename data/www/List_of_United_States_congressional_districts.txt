This is a complete list of congressional districts for representation in the United States House of Representatives. The quantity (apportionment) and boundaries (redistricting) of districts are determined after each census, although in some cases states have changed the boundaries more than once per census. This list includes the 435 current and over 200 obsolete districts. For example, since the 2000 census, Nebraska has had three districts, but it used to have as many as six. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Texas had 32 districts, but has since added four due to reapportionment as a result of the 2010 census. Other states have lost districts since the number of congressional seats has been set at 435 by statute. Also included here are the six current and one obsolete delegations without a vote, that represent both citizens within the continental United States (Washington, D.C.) as well as those living in territories controlled by the United States government.
The boundaries of districts often shift with each redistricting. Over time, the region and demographics represented in a district can change substantially. Furthermore, districts sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.
