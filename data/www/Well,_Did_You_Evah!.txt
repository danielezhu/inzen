"Well, Did You Evah!" is a song written by Cole Porter for his 1939 musical DuBarry Was a Lady, where it was introduced by Betty Grable and Charles Walters.
It was later performed by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra in the 1956 film High Society, which today is probably the most famous version of the song.
It appears in the film At Long Last Love (1975), where it was performed by Burt Reynolds, Cybill Shepherd, Madeline Kahn, and Duilio Del Prete, and is also in De-Lovely (2004), a musical biopic that features Kevin Kline as Cole Porter.
