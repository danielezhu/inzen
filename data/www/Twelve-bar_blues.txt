The twelve-bar blues or blues changes is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music. The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics, phrase, chord structure, and duration. In its basic form, it is predominantly based on the I, IV, and V chords of a key.
The blues can be played in any key. Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are "critical elements for building a jazz repertoire".
