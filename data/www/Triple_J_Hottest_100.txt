The Triple J Hottest 100 is an annual music listener poll hosted by national Australian radio station, Triple J. The public is invited to vote for their favourite songs of the year, in an online poll conducted two weeks prior to the new year.
The 100 most popular songs are then counted down on Australia Day. The poll attracts over two million votes each year, and their number continues to increase. The poll has grown from 500,000 votes in 2004 to 2.24 million in 2016. It has been referred to as "the world's greatest music democracy". Following the completion of each year's countdown, a compilation CD featuring highlight tracks is released by ABC Music.
