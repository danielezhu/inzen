"Evergreen" is the theme song from the 1976 film A Star Is Born. It was composed and performed by Barbra Streisand with lyrics by Paul Williams, and arranged by Ian Freebairn-Smith. The song was released on the soundtrack album to A Star Is Born.
As composers, Streisand and Williams earned an Academy Award for Best Original Song. the first woman to be honored as a composer. Streisand also earned a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. She and Williams also won Golden Globes for Best Original Song.
The song's opening couplet, "Love, soft as an easy chair, love fresh as the morning air," almost did not appear that way. Williams wrote the morning air line first, but told Streisand to "flip those two first lines, because it sings better."
In 1997, the track appeared on the tribute album Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute.
