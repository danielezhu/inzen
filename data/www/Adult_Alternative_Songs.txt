Adult Alternative Songs, also known as Triple A, is a record chart currently published by Billboard that ranks the most popular songs on adult album alternative radio stations. The 30-position chart is formulated based on each song's weekly radio spins, as measured by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. The earliest incarnation of the chart was first published on January 20, 1996 as a feature in Billboard sister publication Airplay Monitor. In 2006, Airplay Monitor ceased publication after Billboard parent company VNU Media's acquisition of rival radio trade magazine Radio & Records, which then subsequently incorporated Airplay Monitor's Nielsen-based Triple A chart.
Billboard itself began publishing the Triple A chart in the issue dated July 5, 2008 through their Billboard.biz website, appropriating the same airplay data as Radio & Records. Radio & Records closed in June 2009, leaving Billboard as the sole publisher of the chart. In February 2014, the chart's reporting panel was expanded from 23 to 32 stations, including non-commercial reporters for the first time. The current number-one single, as of the chart for the week ending July 1, 2017, is "Feel It Still" by Portugal. The Man.
