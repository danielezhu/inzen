Ella Loves Cole is a 1972 studio album by Ella Fitzgerald, arranged by Nelson Riddle, of songs written by Cole Porter.
This was Fitzgerald's first album of songs dedicated to a single composer since 1964's Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book (also arranged by Riddle), and her second collection of songs by Porter, her first since 1956's Cole Porter songbook. She later recorded Ella Abra√ßa Jobim, dedicated to Antonio Carlos Jobim. Fitzgerald and Riddle would collaborate again on her 1982 album The Best Is Yet to Come.
The album was re-released on Pablo as Dream Dancing in 1978, with the addition of two new tracks; "Dream Dancing" and "After You". Ella Loves Cole was remastered again in 2002, with colours added to the cover.
