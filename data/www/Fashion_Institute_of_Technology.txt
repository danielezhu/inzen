The Fashion Institute of Technology, generally known as FIT, is a State University of New York (SUNY) college of art, business, design, mass communication and technology connected to the fashion industry, with an urban campus located on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.
It was founded in 1944, accredited in 1957, and is ranked among the top five fashion schools in the world. It has an enrollment of more than 9,567 students. In 1967 FIT faculty and staff won the first higher education union contract in New York State. Since that time the UCE-FIT has continued to define and protect the working conditions of its members and the practice of shared governance of the college that the contract stipulates.
