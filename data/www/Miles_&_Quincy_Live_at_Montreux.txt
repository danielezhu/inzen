Miles & Quincy: Live at Montreux is a collaborative live album by American jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and conductor Quincy Jones. It was recorded at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival and released by Warner Bros. Records in 1993. For the first time in three decades, Davis returned to the songs arranged by Gil Evans from his past albums, including Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1959), and Sketches of Spain (1960). This album was also the last album recorded by Davis (though recordings from nine days later, despite being recorded at Lyon, would be included on the "The Complete Miles Davis at Montreux" box set).
Miles & Quincy: Live at Montreux charted at number one on the Billboard Top Jazz Albums. It won Davis his seventh Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.
