The Flying Burrito Brothers was a seminal American country rock band, best known for their influential 1969 debut album, The Gilded Palace of Sin. Although the group is perhaps best known for its connection to band founders Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman (formerly of The Byrds), the group underwent many personnel changes and has existed in various incarnations, currently known as "The Burrito Brothers".
