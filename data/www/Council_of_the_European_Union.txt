The Council of the European Union (often still referred to as the Council of Ministers, or sometimes just called the Council (Latin: Consilium)) is the third of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) as listed in the Treaty on European Union. It is part of the essentially bicameral EU legislature (the other legislative body being the European Parliament) and represents the executive governments of the EU's member states. It is based in the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, Belgium.
