The Great Concerts is a jazz live album by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. It was originally released on LP and CD under the series Columbia Jazz Masterpieces, in 1988. Then, it was re-released in 1998 and again in 2009. It includes live recordings from 1958 and 1963 (see below for an accurate description of the recordings). The pieces were produced by associated producers: the first six tracks were produced by Teo Macero and Mike Berniker; track 7 and 8 by Berniker and Cal Lampley.
Most of the material had been previously released on now out-of-print LPs, In Europe and At Carnegie Hall. However, some of the tracks included here are previously unreleased.
