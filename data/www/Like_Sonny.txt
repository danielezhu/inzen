Like Sonny is a posthumous studio album combining two sessions from 1958 and 1960 with jazz musician John Coltrane. The six tracks from November 1958 had been released under Ray Draper's name as A Tuba Jazz on Jubilee Records. The other tracks were recorded by the John Coltrane Quartet in Los Angeles with Billy Higgins on drums and had been released by Roulette in 1962. Only the alternate take of "Exotica" had been unissued.
