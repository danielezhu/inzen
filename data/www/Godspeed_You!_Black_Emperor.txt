Godspeed You! Black Emperor is a Canadian experimental music collective which originated in Montreal, Quebec in 1994. The group releases recordings through Constellation, an independent record label also located in Montreal. After the release of their debut album in 1997, the group toured regularly from 1998 to 2002. In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up, but finally reconvened for a tour which began in late 2010. In October 2012, they released their fourth album, 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!, followed in March 2015 by their fifth album, Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress.
The band has gained a dedicated cult following and remains very influential in the post-rock genre. In September, 2013, Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! won the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.
