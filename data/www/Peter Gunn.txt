Peter Gunn is an American private eye television series which aired on the NBC and (later) ABC television networks from 1958 to 1961. The series was created by Blake Edwards (who, on occasion, was also writer and director). Episodes were also directed by Boris Sagal, Robert Gist, Jack Arnold, Lamont Johnson, Robert Altman (for one episode) and several others. A total of 114 thirty-minute episodes were produced by Spartan Productions. Season one was filmed at Universal Studios, while seasons two and three were filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Philip H. Lathrop and William W. Spencer were cinematographers on many episodes. Craig Stevens' wardrobe was tailored by Don Richards and Lola Albright's fashions by Jax.
The series is probably best remembered today for its music, especially the popular "Peter Gunn Theme", which won an Emmy Award and two Grammys for Henry Mancini and subsequently has been performed and recorded by many jazz, rock, and blues musicians. The series was No. 17 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1958â€“1959 TV season.
