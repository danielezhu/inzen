In music, an altered chord, an example of alteration (see below), is a chord with one or more diatonic notes replaced by a neighboring pitch in the chromatic scale. The simplest use of altered chords is the use of "borrowed" chordsâ€”borrowed from the tonic minor of a major key, or from the tonic major of a minor key.
