Price Stern Sloan (originally known as Price/Stern/Sloan) or PSS! is a publisher (now an imprint of the Penguin Group) that was founded in Los Angeles in the early 1960s to publish the Mad Libs that Roger Price and Leonard Stern had concocted during their stint as writers for Tonight Starring Steve Allen and also the Droodles. Along with their partner Larry Sloan, they expanded the company into children's books, novelty formats, and humor. Some of the books they publish include movie tie-ins for films such as Happy Feet, Wallace and Gromit, Catwoman, and Elf, How to Be a Jewish Mother (1964), Jack S. Margolis' Complete Book of Recreational Drugs (1978) and other properties such as Serendipity, Mr. Men and Little Miss, Wee Sing, Baby Loves Jazz, and books by children's artist and designer Salina Yoon. Today, PSS! still publishes approximately ten Mad Libs books a year. Mr. Stern and Mr. Sloan went on to found Tallfellow Press in Los Angeles.
The Putnam Publishing Group (now the Penguin Group, and now part of Penguin Random House) bought Price Stern Sloan in 1993, and in 1997 the headquarters were moved to New York.
