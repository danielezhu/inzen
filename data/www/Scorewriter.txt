A scorewriter, or notation software or music notation processor, is software used with a computer for creating, editing and printing sheet music. A scorewriter is to music notation what a word processor is to word text, in that they both allow fast corrections (undo), flexible editing, easy sharing of electronic documents (via the Internet or compact storage media), and clean, uniform layout. In addition, most scorewriters, especially those from the 2000s, are able to sound out the notes using synthesizer instrument sounds or virtual instruments and record the notes (sound). This playback and recording feature is especially useful for novice composers or music students or when no musicians (particularly the very costly full orchestra) are readily available or affordable. The playback and recording features, by the same analogy, makes 2000s-era scorewriters equivalent to both word processors and previsualization software.
