The Yale School of Music is one of the twelve professional schools at Yale University, offering three graduate degrees: Master of Music (MM), Master of Musical Arts (MMA), and Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA). The School also offers a joint Bachelor of Artsâ€”Master of Music program in conjunction with Yale College, a Certificate in Performance, and an Artist Diploma.
In November 2005, an anonymous donation of $100 million (later revealed to be from Yale alumnus Stephen Adams) endowed full scholarships for all students accepted to the Yale School of Music.
