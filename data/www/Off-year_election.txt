An off-year election is a general election in the United States which is held in odd-numbered years when neither a presidential election nor a midterm election takes place. The term "off-year" may also be used to refer to midterm election years as well.
Off-year elections during odd-numbered years rarely feature any election to a federal office, few state legislative elections, and very few gubernatorial elections. Instead, the vast majority of these elections are held at the municipal level. On the ballot are many mayors, a wide variety of citizen initiatives in various states, and many more local public offices. They may also feature a number of special elections to fill vacancies in various federal, state and local offices.
Because such off-year elections feature far fewer races than either presidential or midterm elections, they generate far lower voter turnout than even-numbered election years.
