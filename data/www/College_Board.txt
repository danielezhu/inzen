College Board is an American not-for-profit organization that was formed in December 1899 as the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) to expand access to higher education. While College Board is not an association of colleges, it runs a membership association of institutions, including over 6,000 schools, colleges, universities and other educational organizations. College Board develops and administers standardized tests and curricula used by Kâ€“12 and post-secondary education institutions to promote college-readiness and as part of the college admissions process. College Board is headquartered in New York City. David Coleman has been the president of College Board since October 2012. He replaced Gaston Caperton, former Governor of West Virginia, who had held this position since 1999.
In addition to managing assessments for which it charges fees, College Board provides resources, tools, and services to students, parents, colleges and universities in the areas of college planning, recruitment and admissions, financial aid, and retention. It is partly funded by grants from various foundations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation until 2009.
