Giuseppe Henry "Pino" Palladino (born 17 October 1957) is a Welsh bassist. A prolific session musician, he is probably best known for playing with The Who since the death of founding member John Entwistle.
Palladino plays a late-1970s, fretless, Music Man StingRay bass guitar, a fretted Fender Precision, and Jaguar basses. His playing has earned him custom instruments bearing his name.
