A d-girl (a.k.a. development girl) is a non-influential, entry-level staffer in a film production company. Responsibilities include: finding and identifying story ideas worthy of adaptation into a script, and potentially a feature film; and writing script coverage for scripts submitted to the production company. In Hollywood's movie industry, a d-girl is the opposite of "player".
