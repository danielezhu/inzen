Jimmy Lyons (December 1, 1931 â€“ May 19, 1986) was an alto saxophone player. He is best known for his long tenure in the Cecil Taylor Unit. Lyons was the only constant member of the band from the mid-1960s until his death in 1986. Taylor never worked with another musician as frequently. Lyons's playing, influenced by Charlie Parker, helped keep Taylor's avant-garde music tethered to the jazz tradition.
