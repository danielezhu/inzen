At the "Golden Circle" Stockholm is a two-volume album by the Ornette Coleman Trio, documenting concerts on the nights of December 3 and 4, 1965, in the Gyllene Cirkeln club in Stockholm. It marked the beginning of Coleman's contract with Blue Note.
The music has been described as "brilliant, optimistic closely unified thematic improvisations". "Snowflakes and Sunshine" marked the introduction of his unconventional violin and trumpet playing. "In Coleman's hands, both instruments are refunctioned into 'sound tools' (...) producers of sounds, rhythms and emotions." The Penguin Guide to Jazz listed both volumes as part of its "Core Collection" and gave each a four-star rating (of a possible four stars).
The 2002 CD reissue includes previously unreleased bonus tracks in both volumes.
