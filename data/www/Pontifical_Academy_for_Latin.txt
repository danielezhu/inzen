The Pontifical Academy for Latin (Latin: Pontificia Academia Latinitatis) is the eleventh and newest pontifical academy. Headquartered in the Vatican City, it was established for the promotion and appreciation of the Latin language and culture. The Academy replaces the Latinitas Foundation and is linked to the Pontifical Council for Culture on which it depends.
It was founded on 10 November 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI with the motu proprio Latina Lingua, with a view to preserve and spread knowledge of the different versions of modern and ancient Latin, including and emphasizing, but by no means limited to, ecclesiastical Latin (Church Latin) as used in the liturgies and Masses of the current Roman Missal of the 2011 Mass of Pope Paul VI (the current one, which is usually said in the vernacular language, or local people's language), as well as the Mass of Pope John XXIII (the most recent version of the pre-Vatican II Tridentine Mass, or Latin Mass, the earlier and alternative form).
Professor Ivano Dionigi and Reverend Father Roberto Spataro were on 10 November 2012 named respectively the inaugural president and secretary of the academy.
