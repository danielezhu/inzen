Australian Geographic is a media business that produces the Australian Geographic magazine, DMag magazine, specialist book titles, travel guides, diaries and calendars and online media. It published editions of the Australian Encyclopaedia. It previously operated the Australian Geographical retail chain stores and Australian Geographic Travel and Australian Geographic Adventures.
Australian Geographic magazine, originally titled Dick Smith's Australian Geographic, is a bi-monthly geographical journal created by Dick Smith in 1986. The magazine focuses mainly on stories about Australia, or about Australian people in other countries. The six editions published each year are available by subscription and on newsstands. They include posters or sheet maps in each edition, as well as photographs and detailed technical illustrations.
Australian Geographic also has a website that includes the entire magazine digital archive.
Each year, a portion of the profits is provided to the Australian Geographic Society, which Australian Geographic claims is the non-profit arm of Australian Geographic. Members of the public were invited to become members and make financial contributions to the Society. In a circular relationship, the magazine was represented to be the "official journal of the Australian Geographic Society". Through its Society, Australian Geographic supports scientific research as well as environmental and community projects. Funds are also used to highlight and support Australian adventurers and produce related diaries, calendars and books.
