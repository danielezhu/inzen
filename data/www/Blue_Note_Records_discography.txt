This is the discography of Blue Note Records, the American jazz record label. Most of the records were studio recordings produced by Alfred Lion or Francis Wolff. The two main series were '1500', which ran from 1955 to 1958, and '4000', which ran c.1958 to 1972. The 'BN-LA' series followed during the 1970s: this series contained many compilations and reissues in addition to new studio albums.
