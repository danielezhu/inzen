The Outer View is an album by George Russell originally released on Riverside in 1962. The album contains performances by Russell with Garnett Brown, Paul Plummer, Don Ellis, Steve Swallow and Joe Hunt and features the recording debut of vocalist Sheila Jordan on one track. The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states that "Composer George Russell's early-'60s Riverside recordings are among his most accessible. For this set Russell and his very impressive sextet are challenged by the complex material".
