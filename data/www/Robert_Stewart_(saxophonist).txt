Robert Stewart is an American saxophonist, drummer, pianist, vocalist, flutist, composer, producer, theologian and author. He is best known for his recordings (The Force and In the Gutta) for music industry mogul Quincy Jones, as the lead tenor saxophonist on trumpeter and internationally acclaimed cultural icon Wynton Marsalis' Blood on the Fields (the only composition in jazz history to win the Pulitzer Prize), and as the proteg√© of the avant-garde saxophone titan Pharoah Sanders. Jazz critic Jason Ankeny declared Stewart to be one of the best saxophonists to emerge at the end of the 20th century. Jazz writer Nicky Baxter calls him "the second coming of Ben Webster." Jazz drum legend Billy Higgins refers to Stewart as "perhaps the most important young artist to come along in decades." Writer Scott Yanow hails Stewart as the most lyrical and melodic improviser of his generation.
