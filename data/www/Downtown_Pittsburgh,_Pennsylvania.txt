**Downtown Pittsburgh** , colloquially referred to as the **Golden Triangle**
, and officially the **Central Business District** ,[2] is the urban downtown
center of Pittsburgh. It is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River
and the Monongahela River whose joining forms the Ohio River. The "triangle"
is bounded by the two rivers. The area features offices for major corporations
such as PNC Bank, U.S. Steel, PPG, Bank of New York Mellon, Heinz, Federated
Investors and Alcoa. It is where the fortunes of such industrial barons as
Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Henry J. Heinz, Andrew Mellon and George
Westinghouse were made. It contains the site where the French fort, Fort
Duquesne, once stood.

In 2013, Pittsburgh had the second-lowest vacancy rate for Class A space among
downtowns in the United States.[3]

## Location[edit]

The Central Business District is bounded by the Monongahela River to the
south, the Allegheny River to the north, and I-579 (Crosstown Boulevard) to
the east. An expanded definition of Downtown may include the adjacent
neighborhoods of Uptown/The Bluff, the Strip District, the North Shore, and
the South Shore.

## Transportation[edit]

### Public transportation[edit]

Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail subway system (known
locally as the "T"), an extensive bus network, and two inclines (Duquesne
Incline and Monongahela Incline). The Downtown portion of the subway has the
following stations:

_T Stations_

  * **Station Square** on the South Shore in the Station Square development (street-level station)
  * **First Avenue** near First Avenue  & Ross Street, Downtown (elevated station)
  * **Steel Plaza** at Sixth Avenue  & Grant Street, Downtown (underground station)
  * **Penn Plaza** near Liberty Avenue  & Grant Street, Downtown (underground, limited service)
  * **Wood Street** at the triangular intersection of Wood Street, Sixth Avenue, and Liberty Avenue, Downtown (underground station)
  * **Gateway Center** at Liberty Avenue  & Stanwix Street, Downtown (underground station)
  * **North Side** near General Robinson Street  & Tony Dorsett Drive on the North Shore (underground station)
  * **Allegheny** near Allegheny Avenue  & Reedsdale Street on the North Shore (elevated station)

Downtown is also home to an Amtrak train station connecting Pittsburgh with
New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. to the east and Cleveland
and Chicago to the west. Greyhound's Pittsburgh bus terminal is located across
Liberty Avenue from the Amtrak Station, in the Grant Street Transportation
Center building.

### Highways[edit]

Major roadways serving Downtown from the suburbs include the "Parkway East"
(I-376) from Monroeville, the "Parkway West" (I-376) from the airport area,
and the "Parkway North" (I-279) from the North Hills, and (I-579) in Downtown
Pittsburgh. Other important roadways are Pennsylvania Route 28, Pennsylvania
Route 51, Pennsylvania Route 65, and U.S. Route 19.

Three major entrances to the city are via tunnels: the Fort Pitt Tunnel and
Squirrel Hill Tunnel on I-376 and the Liberty Tunnels. The New York Times once
called Pittsburgh "the only city with an entrance,"[4] specifically referring
to the view of Downtown that explodes upon drivers immediately upon exiting
the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Also traveling I-279 south and I-376, the city "explodes
into view" when coming around a turn in the highway.

### Local streets[edit]

Wood Street.

Downtown surface streets are based on two distinct grid systems that parallel
the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.[5] These two grids intersect along
Liberty Avenue, creating many unusual street intersections. Furthermore, the
Allegheny grid contains numbered streets, while the Monongahela grid contains
numbered avenues. And, in fact, there are cases where these numbered roadways
intersect, creating some confusion (i.e. the intersection of Liberty Avenue
and 7th Street/6th Avenue). This unusual grid pattern leads to Pittsburghers
giving directions in the terms of landmarks, rather than turn-by-turn
directions.[5]

### Bridges[edit]

Main article: Pittsburgh Bridges

At least seventeen of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo.

Pittsburgh is nicknamed "The City of Bridges". In Downtown, there are 10
bridges (listed below) connecting to points north and south. The expanded
definition of Downtown (including the aforementioned surrounding
neighborhoods) includes 18 bridges. Citywide there are 446 bridges. In
Allegheny County the number exceeds 2,200.

##  Downtown districts[edit]

Downtown contains a wealth of historic, cultural, and entertainment sites.
While most people still consider the entire Downtown as one neighborhood,
there are several significant subdistricts within the Golden Triangle.

  * The **Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District** is a historic district in the central business district. It is bounded by Wood Street, Forbes Avenue, Grant Street, and Liberty Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 17, 1985.[6]
  * **Point State Park** area: At the triangle's tip is Point State Park with its giant fountain and the Fort Pitt Museum. This park was the original site of both Fort Duquesne by the French and the subsequent Fort Pitt by the British.
  * The **Cultural District** along Penn and Liberty avenues on the Allegheny River includes numerous theaters, galleries, and concert halls including Heinz Hall, Byham Theater, O'Reilly Theater, Benedum Center, and Wood Street Galleries as well as restaurants and housing. The Penn-Liberty Historic District encompasses the Penn & Liberty avenue corridor in the Cultural District.
  * The **Fifth & Forbes Corridor** is Downtown's shopping district along Fifth and Forbes avenues and includes historic Market Square. Downtown is home to numerous independent retailers plus large retailers such as Burlington Coat Factory and Brooks Brothers.
  * The **Grant Street** area is the seat of Pittsburgh's and Allegheny County's government and is also a prestigious corporate address with many of the city's tallest skyscrapers.
  * The **Firstside** neighborhood along the Boulevard of the Allies and Fort Pitt Boulevard adjacent to the Monongahela River is an educational and residential district. It is home to Point Park University and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh both of which have high-rise student housing in the neighborhood. Numerous other residential projects are also under construction in this neighborhood.

##  Economy[edit]

Pittsburgh's number of jobs is generally stable.

Downtown Pittsburgh retains substantial economic influence, ranking at 25th in
the nation for jobs within the urban core and 6th in job density.[7]

University of Pittsburgh economist Christopher Briem notes that the level of
employment in the city has remained largely constant for the past 50 years:
"[the] time series of jobs located in the City proper are about as stable as
any economic metric in the region, or in any other Northeastern US urban core,
over many decades. In 1958, [there were] 294,000 jobs located in the city
proper…Those numbers are virtually identical today which tells me there is a
certain limit to how many jobs can efficiently be located in what are some
relatively (very) constrained areas."[8][ _better  source needed_] These
numbers reflect employment in the city as a whole, not just the central
business district; but the central business district has the highest density
of employment of any Pittsburgh neighborhood.

Pittsburgh has long been a headquarters city, with numerous national and
global corporations calling the Golden Triangle home. Currently, Downtown is
still home to a large number of Fortune 500 companies (8 in the metro area, 6
of which are in the city in 2009, which ranks Pittsburgh high nationally in
Fortune 500 headquarters):

  * Allegheny Technologies

– headquartered in PPG Place

  * H. J. Heinz Company

– headquartered in the PPG Place

  * PNC Financial Services

– headquartered in One PNC Plaza

  * PPG Industries

– headquartered in PPG Place

  * WESCO International

Downtown is also home to GNC, Dollar Bank, Equitable Resources, Duquesne
Light, Federated Investors and Highmark as well as the regional headquarters
for Citizens Bank, Ariba, and Dominion Resources. Regional healthcare giant
UPMC has its corporate headquarters in the US Steel Tower.
