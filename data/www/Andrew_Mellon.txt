**Andrew William Mellon** (/ ˈmɛlən/; March 24, 1855 – August 26, 1937) was an
American banker, businessman, industrialist, philanthropist, art collector,
and politician. From the wealthy Mellon family of Pennsylvania, he established
a vast business empire before transitioning into politics. He served as United
States Secretary of the Treasury from March 9, 1921 to February 12, 1932,
presiding over the boom years of the 1920s and the Wall Street crash of 1929.
A conservative Republican, Mellon lowered taxes and government spending in the
aftermath of World War I.

The son of banker Thomas Mellon, Andrew Mellon quickly established himself in
the financial world. He became an owner of the family banking business, T.
Mellon & Sons, and branched out into other businesses. Mellon helped finance
the establishment of Alcoa, the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Old
Overholt whiskey, and several other companies. By the 1920s, he was one of the
richest people in the country, paying more in income taxes than all but two
other American industrialists. Mellon also became a prominent philanthropist,
helping to establish the National Gallery of Art and the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research, which is now part of Carnegie Mellon University.

In 1921, Warren G Harding chose Mellon as his treasury secretary. Mellon would
remain in office until 1932, serving under Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and
Herbert Hoover, all three of whom were members of the Republican Party. Mellon
sought to reduce federal taxation and debt. He favored cutting the federal
estate tax as well as income taxes on top earners, though he also sought tax
cuts for all income levels. His policies were enacted by Congress in the
Revenue Act of 1921, the Revenue Act of 1924, and the Revenue Act of 1926. The
national debt dropped dramatically during the 1920s, though it would rise
again after 1929. Mellon also participated in international agreements such as
the Mellon–Berenger Agreement, which reduced French debts from World War I.

Mellon became unpopular after the onset of the Great Depression. According to
Hoover, Mellon advised him to avoid intervening in the ongoing economic
crisis. In 1932, the United States House of Representatives began conducting
impeachment hearings against Mellon. Before the conclusion of the proceedings,
Mellon accepted appointment to the position of United States Ambassador to the
United Kingdom. He served in that post for the remainder of Hoover's
presidency before retiring from public office in 1933.

## Early life[edit]

Mellon was born in Pennsylvania on March 24, 1855. His name is listed on the
1860 Census as "William A. Mellon." His father was Thomas Mellon, a banker and
judge who was a Scots-Irish immigrant from County Tyrone, Ireland; his mother
was Sarah Jane Negley Mellon. He had three older brothers, Thomas A., James R.
and Samuel, and he also had a younger brother named Richard B. Mellon. He was
educated at the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of
Pittsburgh) and left before graduating.[1]

## Business career[edit]

Mellon demonstrated financial ability early. In 1872 his father set him up in
a lumber and coal business, which he soon turned into a profitable enterprise.
He joined his father's banking firm, T. Mellon & Sons, in 1880 and two years
later had ownership of the bank transferred to him. In 1889, Mellon helped
organize the Union Trust Company and Union Savings Bank of Pittsburgh. He also
branched into industrial activities: oil, steel, shipbuilding, and
construction.

Areas where Mellon's backing created giant enterprises included aluminum,
industrial abrasives ("carborundum"), and coke. Mellon financed Charles Martin
Hall, whose refinery grew into the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). He
became the partner of Edward Goodrich Acheson in manufacturing silicon
carbide, a revolutionary abrasive, in the Carborundum Company. He created an
entire industry through his help to Heinrich Koppers, inventor of coke ovens
which transformed industrial waste into usable products such as coal-gas,
coal-tar, and sulfur. Mellon also became an early investor in the New York
Shipbuilding Corporation.[2]

Mellon was one of the wealthiest people in the United States, the third-
highest income-tax payer in the mid-1920s, behind John D. Rockefeller and
Henry Ford.[1] While he served as Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department
his wealth peaked at around $300–$400 million in 1929–1930.

Mellon was a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club (whose earthen
dam failed in May, 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood), and he belonged to the
Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh. Along with his closest friends Henry Clay Frick
and Philander Knox (also South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club members), Mellon
served as a director of the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce.[3]

### Old Overholt whiskey[edit]

Mellon also was one-third owner with Frick and one Charles W. Mauck in the Old
Overholt whiskey distillery in West Overton, Pennsylvania.[4] At the time, Old
Overholt was one of the largest and most respected whiskey producers in the
country.[5] In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country,
Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, although
they retained ownership in the company.[5] It is believed that Mellon's
connections in the Treasury Department are what allowed the company to secure
a medicinal permit during Prohibition.[5] This permit allowed Overholt to sell
existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use.[5]

When Frick died in December 1919, he left his share to Mellon.[5] In 1925,
under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a
New York grocer.[5]

## Political career[edit]

### Secretary of the Treasury[edit]

Andrew Mellon was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by new President Warren
G. Harding in 1921. He served for 10 years and 11 months; the third-longest
tenure of a Secretary of the Treasury. His service continued through the
Coolidge and Hoover administrations. Along with Secretary of Agriculture James
Wilson and Secretary of Labor James J. Davis, he is one of only three Cabinet
members to serve in the same post under three consecutive Presidents.

Harding, in his inaugural address on March 4, 1921, called for a prompt and
thorough revision of the tax system, an emergency tariff act, readjustment of
war taxes, and creation of a federal budget system. These were policies Mellon
wholeheartedly subscribed to, and his long experience as a banker qualified
him to set about implementing these programs immediately. As a conservative
Republican and a financier, Mellon was irritated by the manner in which the
government's budget was maintained, with expenses due now and rising rapidly,
with the failure of income or revenues to keep pace with those expense
increases, and with the lack of savings.

In 1926 Mellon was involved in drafting the Mellon-Berenger Agreement to set
the amount of French debts to the United States arising from loans during
World War I and define the repayment schedule. The agreement was named after
him and the French Ambassador Henry Bérenger who signed the agreement in April
1926 subject to ratification by the French parliament. The agreement greatly
reduced the amount owing, but was felt to be as much as the French would be
able to pay.[6]

Mellon was a key negotiator on Germany's war debt, even traveling to Paris in
the summer of 1931 to conduct talks on it. He responded to fears that Germany
might strike out against its debt plight with: "everything will work out all
right".[7]

#### Mellon plan[edit]

Portrait photograph of A.W. Mellon, 1924

Mellon came into office with a goal of reducing the huge federal debt from
World War I. To do this, he needed to increase federal receipts and decrease
federal spending. He believed that if the tax rates were too high, people
would try to avoid paying them. Mellon also believed that by reducing taxes
the federal government could actually increase receipts, an idea he termed
"scientific taxation." He observed that as tax rates had increased during the
first part of the 20th century, investors moved to avoid the highest rates, by
choosing tax-free municipal bonds, for instance. As Mellon wrote in 1924:[8]

> The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are
not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw
his capital from productive business.

If the rates were set more reasonably, taxpayers would have less incentive to
avoid paying. His theory was that by lowering the tax rates across the board,
he could increase the overall tax revenue. This is similar to the Laffer
curve.

Andrew Mellon's plan had four main points:

  1. Cut the top income tax rate from 77 to 24 percent – predicting that large fortunes would be put back into the economy.
  2. Cut taxes on low incomes from 4 to 1/2 percent – tax policy "must lessen, so far as possible, the burden of taxation on those least able to bear it."
  3. Reduce the federal estate tax – large income taxes tempted the wealthy to shift their fortunes into tax-exempt shelters.
  4. Efficiency in government – lower tax rates meant few tax returns to process by few government workers; cutting the actual size of paper bills to fit into wallets saved expenses in paper and ink.

Mellon believed that the income tax should remain progressive but with lower
rates than those enacted during World War I. He thought that the top income
earners would willingly pay their taxes only if rates were 25% or lower.
Mellon proposed tax rate cuts, which Congress enacted in the Revenue Acts of
1921, 1924, and 1926. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 73% to 58% in
1922, 50% in 1923, 46% in 1924, 25% in 1925, and 24% in 1929. Rates in lower
brackets were also cut substantially, relieving burdens on the middle-class,
working-class, and poor households.

By 1926, 65% of the income tax revenue came from incomes $300,000 and higher,
when five years prior, less than 20% did.[ _dubious – discuss_] During this
same period, the overall tax burden on those that earned less than $10,000
dropped from $155 million to $32.5 million.[9]

Mellon also championed preferential treatment for "earned" income relative to
"unearned" income. As he argued in his 1924 book, _Taxation: The People's
Business_[10]

> The fairness of taxing more lightly incomes from wages, salaries and
professional services than the incomes from business or from investments is
beyond question. In the first case, the income is uncertain and limited in
duration; sickness or death destroys it and old age diminishes it. In the
other, the source of the income continues; the income may be disposed of
during a man's life and it descends to his heirs.

>

> Surely we can afford to make a distinction between the people whose only
capital is their mental and physical energy, and the people whose income is
derived from investments. Such a distinction would mean much to millions of
American workers and would be an added inspiration to the man who must provide
a competence during his few productive years to care for himself and his
family when his earning capacity is at an end.[11]

Mellon's policies helped reduce the overall public debt (the national debt
skyrocketed from $1.5 billion in 1916 to $24 billion in 1919 because of World
War I obligations) from $33 billion in 1919 to about $16 billion in 1929,[12]
but then the Depression caused it to rise again because of reduced revenue and
increasing spending. The top tax rate went to 80% by 1935 and the federal
government increased excise taxes in an attempt to make up for the lost
revenue.[9]

Mellon's tax plan also had social ramifications on society and the cultural
development of the American people. The tax reforms exemplified the transition
from a 19th-century rural society to the industrial capitalist power the
country had become into the 1920s. Populists and rebellious Republicans
representing constituencies from the South, West, and mid-West, all opposed
Mellon's tax reforms because they were resistant to trend toward an urban
society.[13] Since the tax system is a legal system bound by the law, the
economic ramifications of its implementation transformed society's interaction
and contribution to the overall economy. Mellon's tax plan replaced the United
States main source of revenue from national tariffs and general state property
taxes to a progressive income tax system. Combined with a pro-big business
dominant political ideology and the reformation of the federal government's
revenue stream, Mellon's tax cut on the wealthy and big corporations
encouraged greater investment by wealthy individuals and big companies.[13] He
believed the tax cut's effectiveness on encouraging investment spending was
more beneficial to the economy than placing a higher tax burden on the rich.
As Mellon had postulated, reducing tax rates on the wealthy class encouraged
wealthy individuals to invest more into projects that contributed to the
infrastructural development of cities and neighborhoods within. In New York
City during the 1920s, the social ramifications were realized as many
neighborhoods sprang up and were settled by people of different ethnicities
and income that has given the city the cultural diversity for which it is
known today.[14]

### Great Depression[edit]

Mellon became unpopular with the onset of the Great Depression. Herbert
Hoover, in memoirs published decades later, wrote that Mellon advised him as
President to "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate
real estate... it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of
living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more
moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from
less competent people." Hoover claimed credit for disregarding this advice and
intervening in the market, though with little success.[15] There is no
corroboration that Mellon ever said such a thing, however, and the claim that
he did is inconsistent with his published speeches, which supported anti-
recessionary measures by the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary, Mellon
was an ex-officio member of the Federal Reserve Board. There, he successfully
urged the Fed to cut its discount rate after the stock market crash in October
1929, and supported subsequent rate cuts, although only a third of the
commercial banks were a part of the Federal Reserve and could benefit from the
rate cuts.[16] In November 1929, he recommended a cut of 1 percentage point in
personal and corporate income tax rates. He supported Hoover's proposal to
increase federal construction spending as an antirecession measure.[1]

In 1929–31, Mellon spent much of the time overseas, negotiating for repayment
of European war debts from World War I. In 1928 Mellon issued a denial to
allegations made by a speaker for the Democratic Party in North Carolina that
he held an interest in a liquor distillery, and that he was the largest
distiller in the world prior to Prohibition. In a letter written to the
Republican executive committee of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Mellon
admits having stock in a distillery, but that he had disposed of all interest
in the company prior to becoming Secretary of the Treasury.[17]

#### Impeachment proceedings[edit]

In January 1932, 25,000 jobless men from Pennsylvania (Cox's Army) marched to
Washington to petition Congress and Hoover to start a job program. Hoover,
fearing Communist agitation, ordered an investigation. The investigation
discovered that while the march was not financed by Mellon, he did write a
personal check so that 276 participants in the march could return to
Pittsburgh. This action may have undermined Hoover's faith in his Treasury
Secretary and, coupled with the impeachment hearing (below) led to Mellon's
resignation.[18]

In January 1932, Rep. Wright Patman (D-TX) (later an F.D.R. New Deal
supporter) and others introduced articles of impeachment against Mellon,[19]
with hearings before the House Judiciary Committee at the end of that
month.[20] After the hearings were over, but before the scheduled vote on
whether to report the articles to the full House, Mellon accepted an
appointment to the post of Ambassador to the Court of St. James and resigned
as Treasury secretary in February. He served for one year as ambassador and
then retired to private life. Representative Louis Thomas McFadden (R-PA)
invoked Mellon's appointment while an impeachment was pending in his
subsequent attempt to impeach President Hoover.[ _clarification needed_ ]

## Personal life[edit]

In 1900, Mellon, then 45 years old, married Nora Mary McMullen (1879–1973), a
20-year-old Englishwoman who was the daughter of Alexander P. McMullen,[21] a
major shareholder of the Guinness Brewing Co. They had two children, Ailsa,
born in 1901, and Paul, born in 1907. Their marriage ended in a bitter divorce
in 1912, which was granted on grounds of Nora Mellon's desertion and her
adultery with Capt. George Alfred Curphey, an English soldier, and other
men.[21] Mellon did not remarry. In 1923 his former wife married Harvey Arthur
Lee, a British-born antiques dealer 14 years her junior.[22] Two years after
the Lees' divorce in 1928, Nora Lee resumed the surname Mellon, at the request
of her son, Paul.[23]

## Philanthropy[edit]

Mellon Institute of Industrial Research

In 1913, along with his brother, Richard B. Mellon, he established a memorial
for his father, the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, as a department
of the University of Pittsburgh. In 1965, the institute merged with the
Carnegie Institute of Technology to form Carnegie Mellon University. Mellon
also served as an alumni president[24] and trustee[25] of the University of
Pittsburgh, and made several major donations to the school, including the land
on which the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel were constructed.[26] In
total it is estimated that Mellon donated over $43 million to the University
of Pittsburgh.[27] During World War I he participated in many fundraising
activities such as the American Red Cross, the National War Council of the
Y.M.C.A., the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State Council of
National Defense, and the National Research Council of Washington.

During his retirement years, as he had done in earlier years, Mellon was an
active philanthropist, and gave generously of his private fortune to support
art and research causes.[28] In 1937, he donated his substantial art
collection, collected at a cost of $25 million and valued at $40 million, plus
$10 million for construction,[29] to establish the National Gallery of Art on
the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Gallery was authorized in 1937 by
Congress.

## The Mellon tax trial[edit]

The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt subjected Mellon to
intense investigation of his personal income tax returns. The US Justice
Department empaneled a grand jury, which declined to issue an indictment.
Roosevelt hated Mellon, as the embodiment of everything he thought was bad
about the 1920s; Mellon vehemently denied the charges. A two-year civil action
beginning in 1935, dubbed the "Mellon Tax Trial", eventually exonerated
Mellon, albeit several months after his death.

## Death[edit]

Mellon died on August 26, 1937, in Southampton, Long Island, New York, and was
buried at Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery, Upperville, Virginia.

## Legacy[edit]

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the product of the merger of the Avalon
Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation (set up separately by his
children), is named in his honor, as is the 378-foot US Coast Guard Cutter
_Mellon (WHEC-717)_. Washington, D.C.'s Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and Andrew
Mellon Building were both named in Mellon's honor as was the National Gallery
of Art during its early years. The Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain in
Washington D.C., located just north of the National Gallery of Art, at
Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution Avenue, and 6th Street NW was created by
Sidney Waugh and dedicated on May 9, 1952, by Harry S. Truman as a memorial to
Andrew Mellon.

##  In popular culture[edit]

Andrew W. Mellon appears in the HBO drama series _Boardwalk Empire_ , in the
fifth, eighth and twelfth episodes of the third season, in his capacity as
Secretary of the Treasury. His character is played by Carnegie Mellon alumnus
James Cromwell.

In the alternate history/time travel story "A Slip in Time" by S. M.
Stirling,[30] featuring a history in which the First World War was avoided and
the Austro-Hungarian Empire survived, Andrew Mellon was the President of the
United States in 1926.
