iTunes LP (referred to in pre-launch press by the code name Cocktail) is a format for interactive album artwork introduced by Apple Inc. on September 9, 2009. It is similar to the CMX format being developed by the three major record labels, and operates within the iTunes 9 to iTunes 12 software, allowing the user to view multimedia elements alongside the music. This format is also used to bundle extra content (known as iTunes Extras) with selected movies at the iTunes Store.
iTunes LP downloads use a proprietary file format with the extension .itlp, which is essentially a WebArchive adhering to special conventions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS Animations, and plists. This technology is referred to in iTunes LP files as TuneKit.
While in the first months after introduction only a limited number of releases were available in this format, more titles were and are gradually being added since the format's existence. On November 28, 2009, the iTunes LP SDK was released to the public.
In 2011, MTV introduced the O Music Awards, intended artists, fans, and innovators at this online awards show. One of the OMAs' inaugural categories was Best iTunes LP. The winner of this category was Pink's Greatest Hits...So Far!!! (Deluxe Edition).
