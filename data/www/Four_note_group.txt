In music, four note group patterns, alternately called "four-note digital patterns" or simply "four note patterns" are one of many ways to formulate improvised solos in jazz. "Four-Note Grouping is an improvisation technique that uses major and minor triads along with specific passing notes as a means of generating lines. The concept of Four-Note Groupings lets the lines be more 'out' and stretch the possibility of available notes over a chord due to the structural integrity of the triad-based line."
Jazz standards are typically two quarter beats per change (or four eighth notes). To play fluidly in double time requires practice strategies that fill out eighth note patterns. Patterns used heavily in bebop and modal playing involve playing scale fragments in the key of the chord change, arpeggiating the current chord change, or various types of chromaticism such as approaches and surrounds. When scales are played they typically line up odd (strong) beats with chord tones and even beats with non-chord tones. These patterns are very obvious in the early solo career of John Coltrane and in reharmonized tunes from the bebop era. The Miles Davis tune "Donna Lee" is composed almost entirely of four note groups over its chord changes.
Four note group patterns can also be doubled into 8 note patterns over the same time duration. Playing at quadruple time over the tempo requires many hours of solo practice and tune analysis. The solos of Charlie Parker contain many examples of four and eight note group patterns.
