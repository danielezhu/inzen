_**Times Higher Education World University Rankings**_ is an annual
publication of university rankings by _Times Higher Education (THE)_ magazine.
The publisher had collaborated with Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) to publish the
joint _THE–QS World University Rankings_ from 2004 to 2009 before it turned to
Thomson Reuters for a new ranking system. The publication now comprises the
world's overall, subject, and reputation rankings, alongside three regional
league tables, _Asia_ , _Latin America_ , and _BRICS & Emerging Economies_
which are generated by consistent methodology. It is considered as one of the
most widely observed university measures together with _Academic Ranking of
World Universities_ and _QS World University Rankings_.[1][2][3] It is praised
for having a new improved methodology but undermining non-English-instructing
institutions and being commercialized are the major criticisms.[4][5][6]

## History[edit]

The creation of the original _Times Higher Education–QS World University
Rankings_ was credited in Ben Wildavsky's book, _The Great Brain Race: How
Global Universities are Reshaping the World_ ,[7] to then-editor of _Times
Higher Education_ , John O'Leary. _Times Higher Education_ chose to partner
with educational and careers advice company QS to supply the data.

After the 2009 rankings, _Times Higher Education_ took the decision to break
from QS and signed an agreement with Thomson Reuters to provide the data for
its annual World University Rankings from 2010 onwards. The publication
developed a new rankings methodology in consultation with its readers, its
editorial board and Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters will collect and analyse
the data used to produce the rankings on behalf of Times Higher Education. The
first ranking was published in September 2010.[8]

Commenting on Times Higher Education's decision to split from QS, former
editor Ann Mroz said: "universities deserve a rigorous, robust and transparent
set of rankings – a serious tool for the sector, not just an annual
curiosity." She went on to explain the reason behind the decision to continue
to produce rankings without QS' involvement, saying that: "The responsibility
weighs heavy on our shoulders...we feel we have a duty to improve how we
compile them."[9]

Phil Baty, editor of the new Times Higher Education World University Rankings,
admitted in Inside Higher Ed: "The rankings of the world's top universities
that my magazine has been publishing for the past six years, and which have
attracted enormous global attention, are not good enough. In fact, the surveys
of reputation, which made up 40 percent of scores and which Times Higher
Education until recently defended, had serious weaknesses. And it's clear that
our research measures favored the sciences over the humanities."[10]

He went on to describe previous attempts at peer review as "embarrassing" in
_The Australian_ : "The sample was simply too small, and the weighting too
high, to be taken seriously."[11] THE published its first rankings using its
new methodology on 16 September 2010, a month earlier than previous years.[12]

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, along with the QS World
University Rankings and the Academic Ranking of World Universities are
described to be the three most influential international university
rankings.[1][13] _The Globe and Mail_ in 2010 described the Times Higher
Education World University Rankings to be "arguably the most influential."[14]

In 2014 Times Higher Education announced a series of important changes to its
flagship THE World University Rankings and its suite of global university
performance analyses, following a strategic review by THE parent company TES
Global.[15]

## Methodology[edit]

### Criteria and weighting[edit]

The inaugural 2010-2011 methodology contained 13 separate indicators grouped
under five categories: Teaching (30 percent of final score), research (30
percent), citations (research impact) (worth 32.5 percent), international mix
(5 percent), industry income (2.5 percent). The number of indicators is up
from the Times-QS rankings published between 2004 and 2009, which used six
indicators.[16]

A draft of the inaugural methodology was released on 3 June 2010. The draft
stated that 13 indicators would first be used and that this could rise to 16
in future rankings, and laid out the categories of indicators as "research
indicators" (55 percent), "institutional indicators" (25 percent), "economic
activity/innovation" (10 percent), and "international diversity" (10
percent).[17] The names of the categories and the weighting of each was
modified in the final methodology, released on 16 September 2010.[16] The
final methodology also included the weighting signed to each of the 13
indicators, shown below:[16]

Overall indicator | Individual indicator | Percentage weighting  
---|---|---  
Industry Income – innovation |

  * Research income from industry (per academic staff)

|

  * 2.5%

  
International diversity |

  * Ratio of international to domestic staff
  * Ratio of international to domestic students

|

  * 3%
  * 2%

  
Teaching – the learning environment |

  * Reputational survey (teaching)
  * PhDs awards per academic
  * Undergrad. admitted per academic
  * Income per academic
  * PhDs/undergraduate degrees awarded

|

  * 15%
  * 6%
  * 4.5%
  * 2.25%
  * 2.25%

  
Research – volume, income and reputation |

  * Reputational survey (research)
  * Research income (scaled)
  * Papers per research and academic staff
  * Public research income/ total research income

|

  * 19.5%
  * 5.25%
  * 4.5%
  * 0.75%

  
Citations – research influence |

  * Citation impact (normalised average citation per paper)

|

  * 32.5%

  
  
The _Times Higher Education_ billed the methodology as "robust, transparent
and sophisticated," stating that the final methodology was selected after
considering 10 months of "detailed consultation with leading experts in global
higher education," 250 pages of feedback from "50 senior figures across every
continent" and 300 postings on its website.[16] The overall ranking score was
calculated by making Z-scores all datasets to standardize different data types
on a common scale to better make comparisons among data.[16]

The reputational component of the rankings (34.5 percent of the overall score
– 15 percent for teaching and 19.5 percent for research) came from an Academic
Reputation Survey conducted by Thomson Reuters in spring 2010. The survey
gathered 13,388 responses among scholars "statistically representative of
global higher education's geographical and subject mix."[16] The magazine's
category for "industry income – innovation" came from a sole indicator,
institution's research income from industry scaled against the number of
academic staff." The magazine stated that it used this data as "proxy for
high-quality knowledge transfer" and planned to add more indicators for the
category in future years.[16]

Data for citation impact (measured as a normalized average citation per
paper), comprising 32.5 percent of the overall score, came from 12,000
academic journals indexed by Thomson Reuters' large Web of Science database
over the five years from 2004 to 2008. The _Times_ stated that articles
published in 2009–2010 have not yet completely accumulated in the
database.[16] The normalization of the data differed from the previous
rankings system and is intended to "reflect variations in citation volume
between different subject areas," so that institutions with high levels of
research activity in the life sciences and other areas with high citation
counts will not have an unfair advantage over institutions with high levels of
research activity in the social sciences, which tend to use fewer citations on
average.[16]

The magazine announced on 5 September 2011 that its 2011–2012 World University
Rankings would be published on 6 October 2011.[18] At the same time, the
magazine revealed changes to the ranking formula that will be introduced with
the new rankings. The methodology will continue to use 13 indicators across
five broad categories and will keep its "fundamental foundations," but with
some changes. Teaching and research will each remain 30 percent of the overall
score, and industry income will remain at 2.5 percent. However, a new
"international outlook – staff, students and research" will be introduced and
will make up 7.5 percent of the final score. This category will include the
proportion of international staff and students at each institution (included
in the 2011–2012 ranking under the category of "international diversity"), but
will also add the proportion of research papers published by each institution
that are co-authored with at least one international partner. One 2011–2012
indicator, the institution's public research income, will be dropped.[18]

On 13 September 2011, the _Times Higher Education_ announced that its
2011–2012 list will only rank the top 200 institutions. Phil Baty wrote that
this was in the "interests of fairness," because "the lower down the tables
you go, the more the data bunch up and the less meaningful the differentials
between institutions become." However, Baty wrote that the rankings would
include 200 institutions that fall immediately outside the official top 200
according to its data and methodology, but this "best of the rest" list from
201 to 400 would be unranked and listed alphabetically. Baty wrote that the
magazine intentionally only ranks around 1 percent of the world's universities
in a recognition that "not every university should aspire to be one of the
global research elite."[19] However, the 2015/16 edition of the Times Higher
Education World University Rankings ranks 800 universities, while Phil Baty
announced that the 2016/17 edition, to be released on 21 September 2016, will
rank "980 universities from 79 countries".[20][21]

The methodology of the rankings was changed during the 2011-12 rankings
process, with details of the changed methodology here.[22] Phil Baty, the
rankings editor, has said that the THE World University Rankings are the only
global university rankings to examine a university's teaching environment, as
others focus purely on research.[23] Baty has also written that the THE World
University Rankings are the only rankings to put arts and humanities and
social sciences research on an equal footing to the sciences.[24] However,
this claim is no longer true. In 2015, QS introduced faculty area
normalization to their QS World University Rankings, ensuring that citations
data was weighted in a way that prevented universities specializing in the
Life Sciences and Engineering from receiving undue advantage.[25]

In November 2014, the magazine announced further reforms to the methodology
after a review by parent company TES Global. The major change being all
institutional data collection would be bought in house severing the connection
with Thomson Reuters. In addition, research publication data would now be
sourced from Elsevier's Scopus database.[26]

### Reception[edit]

The reception to the methodology was varied.

Ross Williams of the Melbourne Institute, commenting on the 2010–2011 draft,
stated that the proposed methodology would favour more focused "science-based
institutions with relatively few undergraduates" at the expense of
institutions with more comprehensive programmes and undergraduates, but also
stated that the indicators were "academically robust" overall and that the use
of scaled measures would reward productivity rather than overall influence.[4]
Steve Smith, president of Universities UK, praised the new methodology as
being "less heavily weighted towards subjective assessments of reputation and
uses more robust citation measures," which "bolsters confidence in the
evaluation method."[5] David Willetts, British Minister of State for
Universities and Science praised the rankings, noting that "reputation counts
for less this time, and the weight accorded to quality in teaching and
learning is greater."[6] In 2014, David Willetts became chair of the TES
Global Advisory Board, responsible for providing strategic advice to Times
Higher Education.[27]

### Criticism[edit]

Times Higher Education places a high importance on citations to generate
rankings. Citations as a metric for effective education is problematic in many
ways, placing universities who do not use English as their primary language at
a disadvantage.[28] Because English has been adopted as the international
language for most academic societies and journals, citations and publications
in a language different from English are harder to come across.[29] Thus, such
a methodology is criticized for being inappropriate and not comprehensive
enough.[30] A second important disadvantage for universities of non Anglo-
Saxon tradition is that within the disciplines of social sciences and
humanities the main tool for publications are books which are not or only
rarely covered by digital citations records.[31]

Times Higher Education has also been criticized for its strong bias towards
institutions that taught 'hard science' and had high quality output of
research in these fields, often to the disadvantage of institutions focused on
other subjects like the social sciences and humanities. For instance in the
former THE-QS World University Rankings, LSE was ranked 11th in the world in
2004 and 2005, but dropped to 66th and 67th in the 2008 and 2009 edition.[32]
In January 2010, THE concluded the method employed by Quacquarelli Symonds,
who conducted the survey on their behalf, was flawed in such a way that bias
was introduced against certain institutions, including LSE.[33]

A representative of Thomson Reuters, THE's new partner, commented on the
controversy: " _LSE stood at only 67th in the last Times Higher Education-QS
World University Rankings – some mistake surely? Yes, and quite a big
one_."[33] Nonetheless, after the change of data provider to Thomson Reuters
the following year, LSE fell to 86th place, with the ranking described by a
representative of Thomson Reuters as 'a fair reflection of their status as a
world class university'.[34] LSE despite being ranked continuously near the
top in its national rankings, has been placed below other British universities
in the Times Higher Education World Rankings in recent years, other
institutions such as Sciences Po have suffered due to the inherent methodology
bias still used. [ _citation needed_ ] Trinity College Dublin's ranking in
2015 and 2016 was lowered by a basic mistake in data it had submitted;
education administrator Bahram Bekhradnia said the fact this went unnoticed
evinced a "very limited checking of data" "on the part of those who carry out
such rankings". Bekhradnia also opined "while Trinity College was a respected
university which could be relied upon to provide honest data, unfortunately
that was not the case with all universities worldwide."[35]

In general it is not clear who the rankings are made for. Many students,
especially the undergraduate students, are not interested in the scientific
work of a facility of higher education. Also the price of the education has no
effects on the ranking. That means that private universities on the American
continent are compared to the European universities. Many European countries
like France, Sweden or Germany for example have a long tradition on offering
free education within facilities of higher education.[36][37]

### Young Universities[edit]

In addition, _THE_ also provides _**150 Under 50 Universities**_ with
different weightings of indicators to accredit the growth of institutions that
are under 50 years old.[46] In particular, the ranking attaches less weight to
reputation indicators. For instance, University of Canberra Australia
established in Year 1990 at the rank 50 of 150 Under 50 Universities.

###  Subject[edit]

Various academic disciplines are sorted into six categories in _THE'_ s
subject rankings: "Arts & Humanities"; "Clinical, Pre-clinical & Health";
"Engineering & Technology"; "Life Sciences"; "Physical Sciences"; and "Social
Sciences".[47]

### Reputation[edit]

Regions with universities included in the reputation league tables.

_THE'_ s _**World Reputation Rankings**_ serve as a subsidiary of the overall
league tables and rank universities independently in accordance with their
scores in prestige.[48]

Scott Jaschik of Inside Higher Ed said of the new rankings: "...Most outfits
that do rankings get criticised for the relative weight given to reputation as
opposed to objective measures. While Times Higher Education does overall
rankings that combine various factors, it is today releasing rankings that
can't be criticised for being unclear about the impact of reputation – as they
are strictly of reputation."[49]

## Regional rankings[edit]

### Asia[edit]

From 2013 to 2015, the outcomes of the _Times Higher Education_ _**Asia
University Rankings**_ were the same as the Asian universities' position on
its World University Rankings. In 2016, the Asia University Rankings was
revamped and it "use the same 13 performance indicators as the THE World
University Rankings, but have been recalibrated to reflect the attributes of
Asia's institutions."[56]
