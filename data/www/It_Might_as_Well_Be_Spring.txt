"It Might as Well Be Spring" is a song from the 1945 film, State Fair. With music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, it won the Academy Award for Best Original Song that year.
State Fair was the only original film score by Rodgers and Hammerstein. In the film the song was sung by Jeanne Crain, who played Margy Frake, but was dubbed by Louanne Hogan. Dick Haymes, the original Wayne Frake, made the first hit recording of the song, released by Decca Records as catalog number 18706. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on November 8, 1945 and lasted 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at #5. It was the flip side of "That's for Me," another top-10 best seller.
