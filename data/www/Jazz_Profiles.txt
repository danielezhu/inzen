Jazz Profiles is an American radio show produced by NPR and hosted by jazz singer Nancy Wilson. It features hour long retrospectives on the lives of famous jazz musicians, or sometimes on famous albums such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. The show covers a wide range of jazz musicians, from the very famous to the lesser known but still notable ones, such as Jon Hendricks. It won a Peabody Award in 2002 "for an innovative presentation of the world of jazz, honoring the works and the great artists of this unique American musical form."
