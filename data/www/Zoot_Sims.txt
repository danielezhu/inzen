John Haley "Zoot" Sims (October 29, 1925 â€“ March 23, 1985) was an American jazz saxophonist, playing mainly tenor but also alto and later soprano. He first gained attention in the "Four Brothers" sax section of Woody Herman's big band, after which he went on to a long solo career, often in partnership with fellow saxmen Gerry Mulligan and Al Cohn or the trombonist Bob Brookmeyer.
