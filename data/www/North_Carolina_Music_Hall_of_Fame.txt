The North Carolina Music Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization and museum in Kannapolis, North Carolina that was created to honor musicians, composers and artists with ties to North Carolina that have made significant impact in the music industry. The museum serves as a clearinghouse for North Carolina musicians from all time periods, and preserves a number of memorabilia artifacts for public display.
In December 2014, the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame relocated to a new home within the Curb Museum for Music and Motorsports at 600 Dale Earnhardt Boulevard.
