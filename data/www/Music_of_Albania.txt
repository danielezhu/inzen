Albanian music (Albanian: Muzikë popullore or Muzikë shqiptare) displays a variety of influences. Albanian folk music traditions differ by region, with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the Ghegs in the North and Tosks in the South. Since the 1920s, some composers such as Fan S. Noli have also produced works of Albanian classical music. One of the most important venues exhibiting traditional Albanian music is the Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival held every five years in Gjirokastër, southern Albania.
