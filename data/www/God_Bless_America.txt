"God Bless America" is an American patriotic song written by Irving Berlin during World War 1 in 1918 and revised by him in the run up to World War 2 in 1938. The later version has notably been recorded by Kate Smith, becoming her signature song.
"God Bless America" takes the form of a prayer (intro lyrics "as we raise our voices, in a solemn prayer") for God's blessing and peace for the nation ("...stand beside her and guide her through the night...").
