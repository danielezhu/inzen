Eric Wayne Ehrmann is an author and columnist who has covered sports, politics and proliferation issues in Latin America for 30 years. His columns arguing that Argentina and Brazil participate in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and honor the Treaty of Tlatelolco (for a nuclear weapons-free Latin America) helped start a groundswell of international opinion that saw both emerging democracies reconcile their strategic defense doctrines with international norms.
From 1968 to 1971 Ehrmann was one of the early feature writers for Rolling Stone, working under co-founder Jann S. Wenner. Later, his 1992 essay describing how the cultural freedom promoted by Rolling Stone helped facilitate regime change in Cold War Eastern Europe was featured in the magazine's 25th anniversary issue and the book "The Best of Rolling Stone, 25 Years of Journalism on the Edge."
His blog columns on global affairs, sports and politics appear on multiple platforms of HuffPost. His print media work has been featured by USA Today, The Christian Science Monitor, The Chicago Tribune, National Review, The New York Times, The Buenos Aires Herald, The Journal of Commerce and The Toronto Star and Algemeiner,a publication discussing Jewish affairs.
For several years Ehrmann has authored the non-partisan "Institutions and Competition" blog on the Russian International Affairs Council website, which is an adjunct of the Russian academy of sciences and published in English and Russian.
Until recently he did predictive analysis with a IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects) activity that was privatized. From 1995 until May, 2017, Ehrmann was a professional member of PEN USA, an affiliate of London-based International PEN, advocating extending to bloggers the human rights protections PEN historically has advocated for writers
