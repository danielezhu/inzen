My Foolish Heart is a 1949 American film which tells the story of a woman's reflections on the bad turns her life has taken. The film was directed by Mark Robson and stars Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward.
Adapted from J. D. Salinger's 1948 short story "Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut", this remains the only authorized film adaptation of Salinger's work; the filmmakers' infidelity to his story famously precluded any possibility of film versions of other Salinger works, including The Catcher in the Rye. The film inspired the Danish story Mit dumme hjerte by Victor Skaarup.
