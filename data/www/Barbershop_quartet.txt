A barbershop quartet is a quartet of singers who sing music in the barbershop genre. It consists of a lead, the vocal part which generally carries the tune; a bass, the part which provides the bass line to the melody; a tenor, the part which harmonizes above the lead; and a baritone, the part that completes the chord. The baritone can sing either above or below the lead singer.
Quartets can be male or female, but are generally not mixed. A female barbershop quartet may be referred to as a Sweet Adelines quartet, and the vocal parts have the same labels, since the roles perform similar functions in the quartet even though the vocal ranges are different.
