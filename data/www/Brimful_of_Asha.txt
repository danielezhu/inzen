"Brimful of Asha" is a 1997 single by British alternative rock band Cornershop. The recording originally reached number 60 on the UK Singles Chart in 1997. After a remixed version by Norman Cook became a radio and critical success, the song was re-released and reached number one on the UK chart in February 1998 and #16 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The lyrics are a tribute to Asha Bhosle.
