R&B Songs is a chart released weekly by Billboard in the United States. It lists the 25 most popular R&B songs, calculated weekly by airplay on rhythmic and urban radio stations, digital download sales and streaming data. It was established on October 11, 2012, as a way to highlight "the differences between pure R&B and rap titles in the overall, wide-ranging R&B/hip-hop field" and serves, along with the Rap Songs chart, as a distillation of the overall Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
