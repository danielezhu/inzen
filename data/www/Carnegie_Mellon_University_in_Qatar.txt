## History[edit]

Carnegie Mellon University's campus in Qatar was established in 2004.[6] It
was the fourth U.S. higher education institution to establish a campus in
Qatar. The establishment of the campuses was spearheaded by Sheikha Moza bint
Nasser, the mother of Qatar’s current Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani.

## Academics[edit]

Carnegie Mellon Qatar is part of Education City, a campus on the outskirts of
Doha that currently houses eight other university campuses from the United
States and Europe. Education City’s other institutions include Georgetown
University School of Foreign Service, Weill Cornell Medical College, Virginia
Commonwealth University, Texas A&M, Northwestern University, HEC Paris, and
University College London.

The degrees issued by Carnegie Mellon are the same degrees and curriculum that
students receive at the Pittsburgh campus. Undergraduate degrees are offered
in Computer Science, Business Administration, Information Systems,
Computational Biology, and Biological Sciences (a degree offered in
conjunction with Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar).

## Funding[edit]

The campus facilities and upkeep to them is entirely covered by the Qatar
Foundation. Carnegie Mellon also received money each year to run the campus
and pay faculty. It is estimated that Carnegie Mellon has received between $50
and $60 million per year from Qatar to run the campus.[7][8] Tuition for the
school was $49,610 in 2015.[7]

## Faculty[edit]

As of December 2015, the campus had 62 faculty members.[7] In a _Washington
Post_ article, the dean of the University’s Qatar campus, Ilker Baybars,
called faculty recruiting “the most difficult part of [his] job”, noting that
it is difficult to persuade tenured professors to leave America for Doha. In
order to persuade professors to teach at the Doha campus, the university has
provided incentives such as salary premiums, generous housing arrangements,
and research funding .[9]

##  Buildings[edit]

Carnegie Mellon Qatar is housed in a building designed by architects Legorreta
+ Legorreta. The university began occupancy in August 2008. All academics,
student affairs, operations, and events are held in the building.

## Criticisms[edit]

Some have criticized the Qatari government for placing too much emphasis on
and giving too much funding to international institutions of higher education
which serve only the country's elite, without also demonstrating, and
stimulating, the quality of national institutions.[10]

Education City has been the subject of criticism for its hosting of extremist
preachers at its mosque.[11] This is in violation of the very prominent Jeddah
Communique signed by the GCC member states and the US to commit to combat the
threat of terrorism.[11][12] Announcements of these types of speakers are
regularly promoted by Education City’s Housing and Residence Life to Education
City students.[11] While American institutions of higher education place
strong emphasis on freedom of speech and religion, these types of hate
preachers openly speak out against these principles and create an intolerant
atmosphere for students of Education City. For this reason, Carnegie Mellon,
along with other Education City institutions, has been the subject of
criticism over whether the large amount of funding they receive provides an
incentive for them to remain silent about hate preachers at Education City and
other issues such as Qatar’s sponsorship of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda
and ISIS and its abysmal human rights record.[8][9][11][13]

Carnegie Mellon, along with the other institutions of Education City, has also
been the subject of questions over how a U.S. institution that values freedom
of speech can function in a country where Islamic Sharia Law is strictly
enforced and the monarchy has absolute power.[9] Critics have repeatedly
called into question the role that Sharia Law plays on university campuses in
Qatar and how this affects the students at Carnegie Mellon and others.[13]
Qatar also adheres to Wahhabism, one of the most fundamental sects of
Islam.[9][14] With these limitations in place due to Qatari societal norms,
the question is raised of whether or not Carnegie Mellon and the rest of
Education City can truly provide the same caliber of academic experiences as
their main U.S. campuses.[9]

Criticism has not only fallen on the universities, but also on Qatar as
critics question whether their motive for hosting the universities is really
to improve higher education opportunities in Qatar, or rather that it is more
about exporting their beliefs.[8]
