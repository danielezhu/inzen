## Academics[edit]

The UAA, a NCAA Division III Conference, is the only NCAA conference to have
all of its member institutions affiliated with the Association of American
Universities, a collection of 60 Ph.D granting research institutions in the
United States.[1] All UAA member schools are private, and ranked in the top 40
of national research universities by U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges
Rankings. Historically, the division was colloquially called the "egghead
eight", or "nerdy nine" when Johns Hopkins was a member. This stems both from
the academic strength of the member schools, and the fact that the conference
prioritizes academic achievement over athletic prowess.[2][3]
