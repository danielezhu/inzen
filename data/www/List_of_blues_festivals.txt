The following is an incomplete list of blues festivals, which encapsulates music festivals focused on blues. This list may have some overlap with list of historic jazz festivals and list of historic rock festivals, both later genres dependent on elements of the blues. The blues is a genre and musical form that originated in African-American communities in the "Deep South" of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre is a fusion of traditional African music and European folk music, spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, such as country blues, Delta and Piedmont, Chicago, West Coast blues. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved, which was featured prominently in the Summer of Love, for example, and became ubiquitous at rock festivals.
