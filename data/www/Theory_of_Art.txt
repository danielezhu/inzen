Theory of Art is a 1987 reissue of A Night in Tunisia, a 1957 jazz album released by Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers for RCA's Vik label. It was remastered and released with new cover art in 1997.
The album is notable in its inclusion of alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, who had recently quit the Jazz Messengers, on a rare date with his replacement, tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin.
The CD re-issue features two additional tracks from a separate date led by Blakey. The band is a rare nonet that includes future Jazz Messenger Lee Morgan, among others.
