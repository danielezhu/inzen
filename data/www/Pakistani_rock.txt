Pakistani rock is a variety of rock music that is largely produced in Pakistan. Pakistani rock incorporates elements of both Britishâ€“American rock and Pakistani classical music.
Since the 1980s, Pakistani rock has had its own distinctive elements, such as a homegrown class of sounds and melodies, spanning progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal, initially influencing the development of heavy metal music in late 1990s. Pakistani rock is almost entirely sung in Urdu, however many bands have issued songs in Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi and English languages.
