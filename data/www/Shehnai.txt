The shehnai, shenoy, sanai, shahnai, shenai, shanai or mangal vadya (Hindi: शहनाई, Bengali: শানাই, Marathi: सनई) is a musical instrument similar to the oboe, common in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is made out of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end. Its sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and, as a result, is widely used during marriages, processions and in temples although it is also played in concerts. The shehnai is similar to South India's nadaswaram.
