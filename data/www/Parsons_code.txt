The Parsons code, formally named the Parsons code for melodic contours, is a simple notation used to identify a piece of music through melodic motionâ€”the motion of the pitch up and down. Denys Parsons developed this system for his 1975 book The Directory of Tunes and Musical Themes. Representing a melody in this manner makes it easy to index or search for particular pieces.
The book was also published in Germany in 2002 and reprinted by Piatkus as The Directory of Classical Themes in 2008.
