Fort Adams State Park is a Rhode Island state park located at the mouth of Newport Harbor, offering panoramic views of the harbor and Narragansett Bay. The park is home to Fort Adams, a large coastal fortification that was active from 1841 through the first half of the 20th century. The area was originally owned by William Brenton, who called the region "Hammersmith" after his hometown in England, a name that survives in the name of the adjacent Hammersmith Farm.
