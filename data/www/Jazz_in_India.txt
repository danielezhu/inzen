Jazz music in India originated in the 1920s in Bombay and in Calcutta, where African-American jazz musicians performed. They inspired Goan musicians who then imbibed jazz into the sounds of Indiaâ€™s Hindi film music industry. There has been much interaction between Indian music and jazz music. An active jazz scene exists today in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Goa and Kolkata
