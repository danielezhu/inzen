Perception Records was an American jazz/R&B record label. What originally began as a production company in 1967 for Pop and Progressive Rock acts, singer/songwriter/producer Jimmy Curtiss transitioned it into Perception Ventures in 1969. Eventually expanding its roster to cater to other genres, Perception's claim to fame was the Soul music output from both of its flagship labels, Perception Records and Today Records, the latter of which was run by Perception's executive vice president, the legendary Patrick Adams.
