London College of Music (LCM) is a music school in London, England. It is one of eight separate Schools which make up the University of West London in the greater London Area.
LCM was founded in 1887 and existed as an independent music conservatoire based at Great Marlborough Street in central London until 1991. The college then moved to Ealing and became part of the Polytechnic of West London (which became Thames Valley University and was renamed the University of West London in 2011).
