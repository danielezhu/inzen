The Young and the Hopeless is the second studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte. Produced by Eric Valentine, the album was released on October 1, 2002, in the United States by Epic and Daylight Records.
The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, but was a major commercial success, going triple platinum in the United States. The album spawned five singles, three of which—"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous", "The Anthem", and "Girls & Boys"—crossed over from modern rock radio to pop radio. In support of the record, the band toured exhaustively, mounting two arena tours in one year.
