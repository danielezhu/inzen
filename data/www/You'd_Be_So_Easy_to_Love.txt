"(You'd Be So) Easy to Love" is a popular song written by Cole Porter and cut from the original production of the musical Anything Goes in 1934. It was later added to the 1936 film Born to Dance, where it was introduced by Eleanor Powell, James Stewart, and Frances Langford under its alternate title, "Easy to Love". The song was only later added to the 1987 and 2011 revivals of Anything Goes under the complete title "Youâ€™d Be So Easy to Love".
