The Golden Melody Awards (Chinese: 金曲獎), or GMA, is an honor awarded by the Ministry of Culture of Taiwan to recognize outstanding achievement in the Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, and Formosan-languages popular and traditional music industry. The GMAs are awarded on the basis of votes by members of jury, and it is considered the equivalent to the Grammy Awards in Chinese-speaking world. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Golden Bell Awards (television) and the Golden Horse Awards (motion pictures).
The first Golden Melody Awards was held on January 6, 1990, to honor the popular music production by performers. Following the 1996 ceremony, the Ministry of Culture overhauled many Golden Melody Award categories for 1997. The 27th Golden Melody Awards was held on June 26, 2016, at the Taipei Arena in Taipei.
