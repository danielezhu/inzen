"We May Never Love Like This Again" is a song written by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn for the 1974 film, The Towering Inferno. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1974, and was performed by Maureen McGovern both for the film score and, briefly, in the film itself with McGovern portraying a singer. McGovern had performed a cover version of Kasha and Hirschhorn's song "The Morning After", which also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song two years earlier.
Her recording of "We May Never Love Like This Again" was issued as a single with McGovern's rendition of "Wherever Love Takes Me", a song from the movie Gold which would compete with "We May Never Love Like This Again" for the Best Song Oscar, serving as B-side. "We May Never Love Like This Again" reached #83 on the Hot 100 in Billboard: the single afforded McGovern a major hit in Australia (#5). Due to her associations with two Oscar-winning songs McGovern recorded Academy Award Performance: And The Envelope, Please an album comprising Oscar-winning songs featuring "The Morning After" and "We May Never Love Like This Again".
Hollywood composer John Williams wrote the original music score for the film, and interpolated the tune of the song into the underscore of the movie. The actual 1974 song recording for the album (subsequently released as a single) was Produced by Carl Madari for Belkie-Madari Productions. It was arranged by Joe Hudson and was Engineered by Arnie Rosenberg.
