In music, tremolo (Italian pronunciation: [ˈtrɛːmolo]), or tremolando ([tremoˈlando]), is a trembling effect. There are two types of tremolo.
The first is a rapid reiteration:
of a single note, particularly used on bowed string instruments by rapidly moving the bow back and forth and plucked strings such as harp, where it is called bisbigliando (Italian pronunciation: [bizbiʎˈʎando]) or "whispering". Tremolo picking, in which a single note is repeated extremely rapidly, is also possible on classical guitar, acoustic guitar and electric guitar.
between two notes or chords in alternation, an imitation (not to be confused with a trill) of the preceding that is more common on keyboard instruments. Mallet instruments such as the marimba are capable of either method.
a roll on any percussion instrument, whether tuned or untuned.
A second type of tremolo is a variation in amplitude:
as produced on organs by tremulants
using electronic effects in guitar amplifiers and effects pedals which rapidly turn the volume of a signal up and down, creating a "shuddering" effect
an imitation of the same by strings in which pulsations are taken in the same bow direction
a vocal technique involving a wide or slow vibrato, not to be confused with the trillo or "Monteverdi trill"
Some electric guitars use a (misnamed) lever called a "tremolo arm" or "whammy bar" that allows a performer to lower or raise the pitch of a note or chord, which is known as vibrato or "pitch bend". This non-standard use of the term "tremolo" refers to pitch rather than amplitude. True tremolo for an electric guitar, electronic organ, or any electronic signal would normally be produced by a simple amplitude modulation electronic circuit. Electronic tremolo effects were available on many early guitar amplifiers. Tremolo effects pedals are also widely used to achieve this effect.
