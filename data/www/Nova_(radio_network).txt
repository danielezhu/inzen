The Nova Network is a group of five Australian radio stations owned wholly or in part by NOVA Entertainment. The Perth station is a joint venture between NOVA Entertainment and the Australian Radio Network.
Like many radio networks, each station has its own local Breakfast show and daytime presenters, with the Drive and Night shifts networked across all stations, the exception being Australia's two largest markets, Sydney and Melbourne, sharing the same daytime announcers.
