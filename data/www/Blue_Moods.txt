Blue Moods is a 1955 album by Miles Davis, released on Charles Mingus' Debut Records label. It brings Davis together with Mingus on bass, trombonist Britt Woodman, vibraphonist Teddy Charles, and drummer Elvin Jones. The arrangement of "Alone Together" is by Mingus, while the other tracks were arranged by Charles.
According to the original sleeve notes, the relatively short playing time of the album was because "the recording was cut at 160 lines per inch (instead of the usual 210 to 260 lines per inch) making the grooves wider and deeper and allowing for more area between the grooves for bass frequencies ... and was deemed necessary to reproduce the extended bass range and give the listener more quality to that of high fidelity tape recording." It was reissued onto CD pairing up with Collectors' Items.
