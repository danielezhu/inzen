**Brooklyn** (/ ˈbrʊklɪn/) is the most populous borough of New York City, with
a census-estimated 2,629,150 residents in 2016.[1] It borders the borough of
Queens at the southwestern end in the same Long Island, and has several bridge
connections to the nearby boroughs of Staten Island and Manhattan. Since 1896,
the borough has been coterminous with **Kings County** , the most populous
county in the U.S. state of New York and the second-most densely populated
county in the United States, after the county of New York (which is
coextensive with the borough of Manhattan).[2]

With a land area of 71 square miles (180 km2) and water area of 26 square
miles (67 km2), Kings County is New York's fourth-smallest county by land area
and third-smallest by total area, though it is the second-largest among the
city's five boroughs.[3] Today, if New York City dissolved, Brooklyn would
rank as the third-most populous city in the U.S. after Los Angeles and
Chicago.

Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized
village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution)
until January 1, 1898, when, after a long political campaign and public
relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of
"Greater New York", Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities, boroughs,
and counties to form the modern "City of New York," surrounding the Upper New
York Bay with five constituent boroughs. The borough continues, however, to
maintain a distinct culture. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves.
Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough seal and flag, is
_Eendraght Maeckt Maght_ which translates from early modern Dutch as "Unity
makes strength".

In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a
renaissance as an avant garde destination for hipsters,[4] with concomitant
gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing
affordability.[5] Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of
entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms,[6][7] and of postmodern
art[8] and design.[7]

## Toponymy[edit]

The name Brooklyn is derived from the original Dutch colonial name
**Breuckelen** , meaning marshland in Dutch. Established in 1646, the name
first appeared in print in 1663.[10] The Dutch colonists named it after the
scenic town of Breukelen, near Utrecht.[11][12] Over the past two millennia,
the name of the ancient town in Holland has been _Bracola_ , _Broccke_ ,
_Brocckede_ , _Broiclede_ , _Brocklandia_ , _Broekclen_ , _Broikelen_ ,
_Breuckelen_ and finally _Breukelen_.[13] The New Amsterdam settlement of
_Breuckelen_ also went through many variations, including _Breucklyn_ ,
_Breuckland_ , _Brucklyn_ , _Broucklyn_ , _Brookland_ , _Brockland_ ,
_Brocklin_ , and _Brookline/Brook-line_. There have been so many variations of
Brooklyn's name it has caused confusion about its origin; some have claimed
_breuckelen_ means "broken land."[14] The final name of Brooklyn, however, is
the most accurate to its meaning.[15][16]

The history of European settlement in Brooklyn spans more than 350 years. The
settlement began in the 17th century as the small Dutch-founded town of
"Breuckelen" on the East River shore of Long Island, grew to be a sizable city
in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then
confined to Manhattan and part of the Bronx), the remaining rural areas of
Kings County, and the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island, to form
the modern City of New York.

### Colonial era[edit]

#### Six Dutch towns[edit]

The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which
was then largely inhabited by the Lenape, an American Indian tribe who are
often referred to in colonial documents by a variation of the place name
"Canarsie". The "Breuckelen" settlement was named after Breukelen in the
Netherlands; it was part of New Netherland, and the Dutch West India Company
lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their
later English names):[17]

  * Gravesend: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of Anabaptist Lady Deborah Moody, possibly after Gravesend, England, or 's-Gravenzande, Netherlands
  * Brooklyn Heights: as "Breuckelen" in 1646, after the town now spelled Breukelen, Netherlands
  * Flatlands: as "New Amersfoort" in 1647
  * Flatbush: as "Midwout" in 1652
  * New Utrecht: in 1657, after the city of Utrecht, Netherlands
  * Bushwick: as "Boswijck" in 1661

Brooklyn Museum.

The colony's capital of New Amsterdam, across the East River, obtained its
charter in 1653, later than the village of Brooklyn. The neighborhood of
Marine Park was home to North America's first tide mill. It was built by the
Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. However, the area was not
formally settled as a town. Many incidents and documents relating to this
period are in Gabriel Furman's 1824 compilation.[18]

#### Six townships in an English province[edit]

Village of Brooklyn and environs, 1766

What is Brooklyn today left Dutch hands after the final English conquest of
New Netherland in 1664, a prelude to the Second Anglo–Dutch War. New
Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize
in honor of the overall English naval commander, James, Duke of York, brother
of the then monarch King Charles II of England and future king himself as King
James II of England and James VII of Scotland; Brooklyn became a part of the
new English and later British colony, the Province of New York.

The English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as
_Kings County_ on November 1, 1683,[19] one of the "original twelve counties"
then established in New York Province. This tract of land was recognized as a
political entity for the first time, and the municipal groundwork was laid for
a later expansive idea of Brooklyn identity.

Lacking the patroon and tenant farmer system established along the Hudson
River Valley, this agricultural county unusually came to have one of the
highest percentages of slavery among the population in the "Original Thirteen
Colonies" along the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of North America.[20]

#### Revolutionary War[edit]

Further information: Battle of Long Island and New York and New Jersey
campaign

The Battle of Long Island was fought across Kings County.

On August 27, 1776, was fought the Battle of Long Island (also known as the
'Battle of Brooklyn'), the first major engagement fought in the American
Revolutionary War after independence was declared, and the largest of the
entire conflict. British troops forced Continental Army troops under George
Washington off the heights near the modern sites of Green-Wood Cemetery,
Prospect Park, and Grand Army Plaza.[21]

Washington, viewing particularly fierce fighting at the Gowanus Creek from
atop a hill near the west end of present-day Atlantic Avenue, was famously
reported to have emotionally exclaimed: "What brave men I must this day
lose!".[22]

The fortified American positions at Brooklyn Heights consequently became
untenable and were evacuated a few days later, leaving the British in control
of New York Harbor. While Washington's defeat on the battlefield cast early
doubts on his ability as the commander, the tactical withdrawal of all his
troops and supplies across the East River in a single night is now seen by
historians as one of his most brilliant triumphs.[22]

The British controlled the surrounding region for the duration of the war, as
New York City was soon occupied and became their military and political base
of operations in North America for the remainder of the conflict. The British
generally enjoyed a dominant Loyalist sentiment from the residents in Kings
County who did not evacuate, though the region was also the center of the
fledgling—and largely successful—American intelligence network, headed by
Washington himself.

The British set up a system of notorious prison ships off the coast of
Brooklyn in Wallabout Bay, where more American patriots died of intentional
neglect than died in combat on all the battlefields of the American
Revolutionary War, combined. One result of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 was the
evacuation of the British from New York City, celebrated by residents into the
20th century.

### Post-colonial era[edit]

#### Urbanization[edit]

A preindustrial _Winter Scene in Brooklyn_ , c. 1819–20, by Francis Guy
(Brooklyn Museum).

The first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of
urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County,
facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The New
York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Brooklyn and
Williamsburgh) for the entire 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.

The first center of urbanization sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly
across from Lower Manhattan, which saw the incorporation of the Village of
Brooklyn in 1817. Reliable steam ferry service across the East River to Fulton
Landing converted Brooklyn Heights into a commuter town for Wall Street. Ferry
Road to Jamaica Pass became Fulton Street to East New York. Town and Village
were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in
1834.

In parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, a little farther up the river,
saw the incorporation of the Village of Williamsburgh in 1827, which separated
as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of
Williamsburgh in 1851. Industrial deconcentration in mid-century was bringing
shipbuilding and other manufacturing to the northern part of the county. Each
of the two cities and six towns in Kings County remained independent
municipalities, and purposely created non-aligning street grids with different
naming systems.

However, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old
infant City of Williamsburgh; it, along with its Town of Bushwick hinterland,
was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1854.

By 1841, with the appearance of _The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County
Democrat_ published by Alfred G. Stevens, the growing city across the East
River from Manhattan was producing its own prominent newspaper.[23] It later
became the most popular and highest circulation afternoon paper in America.
The publisher changed to L. Van Anden on April 19, 1842,[24] and the paper was
renamed _The Brooklyn Daily Eagle and Kings County Democrat_ on June 1,
1846.[25] On May 14, 1849, the name was shortened to _The Brooklyn Daily
Eagle_ ;[26] on September 5, 1938, it was further shortened to _Brooklyn
Eagle_.[27] The establishment of the paper in the 1840s helped develop a
separate identity for Brooklynites over the next century. The borough's soon-
to-be-famous National League baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, also
assisted with this. Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper
closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters'
strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of
major league baseball in 1957.

Agitation against Southern slavery was stronger in Brooklyn than in New York[
_citation needed_ ], and under Republican leadership the city was fervent in
the Union cause in the Civil War. After the war the Henry Ward Beecher
Monument was built downtown to honor a famous local abolitionist. A great
victory arch was built at what was then the south end of town to celebrate the
armed forces; this place is now called Grand Army Plaza.

The city had a population of 25,000 in 1834, but the police department
comprised only 12 men on the day shift and another 12 at night. Every time a
rash of burglaries broke out, officials blamed burglars coming in from New
York City. Finally in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150
men. Voters complained of inadequate protection and excessive costs. In 1857,
the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York
City.[28]

#### Civil War[edit]

"Any Thing for Me, if You Please?" Post Office, 1864

Fervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in
supplying troops and materiel for the American Civil War. The most well-known
regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the 14th Brooklyn _"Red
Legged Devils"_. They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and
were the only regiment named after a city; President Lincoln called them into
service personally, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted
soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War,
the 14th wore a uniform inspired by that of the French Chasseurs, a light
infantry used for quick assaults on the enemy.

As both a seaport and a manufacturing center, Brooklyn was well prepared to
contribute to the Union's strengths in shipping and manufacturing. The two
combined in shipbuilding; the ironclad _Monitor_ was built in Brooklyn.

####  Twin city[edit]

Brooklyn is referred to as a twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, "The New
Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, which appears on a plaque inside the Statue of
Liberty. The poem calls New York Harbor "the air-bridged harbor that twin
cities frame". As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national
affairs that was later overshadowed by its century-old submergence into its
old partner and rival.

Economic growth continued, propelled by immigration and industrialization, and
Brooklyn established itself as the third-most populous American city for much
of the 19th century. The waterfront from Gowanus Bay to Greenpoint was
developed with piers and factories. Industrial access to the waterfront was
improved by the Gowanus Canal and the canalized Newtown Creek. The USS
_Monitor_ was only the most famous product of the large and growing
shipbuilding industry of Williamsburg. After the Civil War, trolley lines and
other transport brought urban sprawl beyond Prospect Park and into the center
of the county.

Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, by Currier and Ives

The rapidly growing population needed more water, so the City built
centralized waterworks including the Ridgewood Reservoir. The municipal Police
Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force
covering also New York and Westchester Counties. In 1865 the Brooklyn Fire
Department (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.

Throughout this period the peripheral towns of Kings County, far from
Manhattan and even from urban Brooklyn, maintained their rustic independence.
The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the
Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852. The building of rail links
such as the Brighton Beach Line in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.

Borough of Brooklyn wards, 1900

Sports became big business, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms played professional
baseball at Washington Park in the convenient suburb of Park Slope and
elsewhere. Early in the next century, under their new name of Brooklyn
Dodgers, they brought baseball to Ebbets Field, beyond Prospect Park.
Racetracks, amusement parks, and beach resorts opened in Brighton Beach, Coney
Island, and elsewhere in the southern part of the county.

Currier and Ives print of Brooklyn, 1886.

Toward the end of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn experienced its
final, explosive growth spurt. Railroads and industrialization spread to Bay
Ridge and Sunset Park. In the space of a decade, the city annexed the Town of
New Lots in 1886, the Town of Flatbush, the Town of Gravesend, the Town of New
Utrecht in 1894, and the Town of Flatlands in 1896. Brooklyn had reached its
natural municipal boundaries at the ends of Kings County.

##### Mayors of the City of Brooklyn[edit]

See also: List of mayors of New York City and Brooklyn borough presidents

Brooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until consolidation in 1898 into the City
of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902–1903), Seth Low, had been
Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885. Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a
separate mayor, elected a Borough President.

### New York City borough[edit]

Further information: History of New York City (1898–1945)

Brooklyn in 1897

In 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no
longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York
were strengthened.

The question became whether Brooklyn was prepared to engage in the still-
grander process of consolidation then developing throughout the region,
whether to join with the county of New York, the county of Richmond and the
western portion of Queens County to form the five boroughs of a united City of
New York. Andrew Haskell Green and other progressives said Yes, and eventually
they prevailed against the _Daily Eagle_ and other conservative forces. In
1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority
to merge, effective in 1898.[30]

Kings County retained its status as one of New York State's counties, but the
loss of Brooklyn's separate identity as a city was met with consternation by
some residents at the time. The merger was called the "Great Mistake of 1898"
by many newspapers of the day, and the phrase still denotes Brooklyn pride
among old-time Brooklynites.[31]

## Geography[edit]

Brooklyn totals 97 square miles (250 km2) in area, of which 71 square miles
(180 km2) is land (73%), and 26 square miles (67 km2) is water (27%); the
borough is the second-largest in land area among the boroughs of New York
City. However, Kings County, coterminous with Brooklyn, is New York State's
fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area.[3]
Brooklyn lies at the southwestern end of Long Island, and the borough's
western border constitutes the island's western tip. Brooklyn's water borders
are extensive and varied, including Jamaica Bay; the Atlantic Ocean; The
Narrows, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Staten Island in New York
City and crossed by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge; Upper New York Bay,
separating Brooklyn from Jersey City and Bayonne in the U.S. state of New
Jersey; and the East River, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Manhattan
in New York City and traversed by the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the Brooklyn
Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and numerous routes of
the New York City Subway. To the east of Brooklyn lies the borough of Queens,
which contains John F. Kennedy International Airport in that borough's Howard
Beach neighborhood, approximately two miles from the border of the East New
York neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Since 2010, the population of Brooklyn was estimated by the United States
Census Bureau to have increased 5.3% to 2,636,735, as of 2015 – Brooklyn's
estimated population represented 30.8% of New York City's estimated population
of 8,550,405; 33.6% of Long Island's population of 7,838,722; and 13.3% of New
York State's population of 19,795,791.[45][46][47][48][49][50]

community in the United States, with approximately 600,000 individuals, about
23% Jewish of the borough's population in 2011.[51]

### 2010 Census[edit]

According to the 2010 United States Census, Brooklyn's population was 42.8%

growing Chinese American population was estimated to have surpassed 200,000 in
2014.[53]

In 2010, Brooklyn had some neighborhoods segregated based on race, ethnicity,
and religion. Overall, the southwest half of Brooklyn is racially mixed
although it contains few black residents; the northeast section is mostly
black and Hispanic/Latino.[54]

### 2012 estimates[edit]

According to the 2012 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, there are 2,565,635 people
(up from 2.3 million in 1990), 880,727 households, and 583,922 families living
in Brooklyn.[55][56] The population density was 34,920/square mile
(13,480/km²). There were 930,866 housing units at an average density of
13,180/square mile (5,090/km²).

Of the 880,727 households in Brooklyn, 38.6% were married couples living

and the average family size was 3.41.

In Brooklyn the population was spread out with 26.9% under the age of 18,
10.3% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who

The median income for households in Brooklyn was $32,135, and the median
income for a family was $36,188. Males had a median income of $34,317, which
was higher than females, whose median income was $30,516. The per capita

below the poverty line, including 34% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those
age 65 or over.

### Languages[edit]

Brooklyn has a high degree of linguistic diversity. As of 2010, 54.12%
(1,240,416) of Brooklyn residents ages 5 and older spoke English at home as a
primary language, while 17.16% (393,340) spoke Spanish, 6.46% (148,012)

Brooklyn's neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition. For example,
during the early to mid-20th century, Brownsville had a majority of Jewish
residents; since the 1970s it has been majority African American. Midwood
during the early 20th century was filled with ethnic Irish, then filled with
Jewish residents for nearly 50 years, and is slowly becoming a Pakistani
enclave. Brooklyn's most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in
1930 to 46.9% by 1990.[60]

Along with gentrification, many of Brooklyn's neighborhoods are also becoming
increasingly diverse, with an influx of immigrants integrating its
neighborhoods. The borough also attracts people previously living in other
cities in the United States. Of these, most come from Chicago, Detroit, San
Francisco, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati, and
Seattle.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68]

### Community diversity[edit]

Given New York City's role as a crossroads for legal and illegal immigration
from around the world, Brooklyn has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambience
of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural
diversity with respect to metrics including nationality, religion, race, and
domiciliary partnership. Brooklyn contains dozens of distinct neighborhoods
representing many of the major culturally identified groups found within New
York City. Among the most prominent are listed below:

#### Jewish American[edit]

Main article: Jews in New York City

Over 600,000 Jews, particularly Orthodox Jews and Hasidic Jews, have become
concentrated in Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Flatbush, where there are many
yeshivas, synagogues, and kosher restaurants, as well as many other Jewish
businesses. Other notable religious Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods
are Kensington, Midwood, Canarsie, Sea Gate, and Crown Heights (home to the
Chabad world headquarters). Many hospitals in Brooklyn were started by Jewish
charities, including Maimonides Medical Center in Borough Park and Brookdale
Hospital in Brownsville.[69][70] Many non-Orthodox Jews are concentrated in
Ditmas Park, Windsor Terrace and Park Slope, with smaller Jewish populations
in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Brighton Beach, and Coney Island.

#### Chinese American[edit]

Main articles: Chinatowns in Brooklyn and Chinese Americans in New York City

Over 200,000 Chinese Americans live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn,
in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, and Homecrest. The largest
concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which is known for Chinese
culture. It is called "Brooklyn's Chinatown" and its Chinese population is
composed in majority by Fuzhounese Americans, rendering this Chinatown with
the nicknames _Fuzhou Town (福州埠), Brooklyn (布鲁克林)_ or the _Little Fuzhou
(小福州)_ of Brooklyn. Many Chinese restaurants can be found throughout Sunset
Park, and the area hosts a popular Chinese New Year celebration.

####  Caribbean and African American[edit]

Main article: Caribbeans in New York City

Brooklyn's African American and Caribbean communities are spread throughout
much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn's West Indian community is concentrated in the
Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods
in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to one of the largest communities of
West Indians outside of the Caribbean, being rivaled only by Toronto, Miami,
Montreal, and London. Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are
mostly Jamaicans, Guyanese and Haitians, there are West Indian immigrants from
nearly every part of the Caribbean. Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to
many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries. Brooklyn has an
annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the
islands. Started by natives of Trinidad and Tobago, the West Indian Labor Day
Parade takes place every Labor Day on Eastern Parkway. Bedford-Stuyvesant is
home to one of the most famous African American communities in the city, along
with Brownsville, East New York, and Coney Island.

#### Latino American[edit]

Further information: Puerto Rican migration to New York City and Nuyorican

Bushwick is the largest hub of Brooklyn's Latino American community. Like
other Latino neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick has an established
Puerto Rican presence, along with an influx of many Dominicans, South
Americans, Central Americans, Mexicans, as well as a more recent influx of
Puerto Ricans. As nearly 80% of Bushwick's population is Latino, its residents
having created many businesses to support their various national and distinct
traditions in food and other items. Sunset Park's population is 42% Latino,
made up of these various ethnic groups. Brooklyn's main Latino groups are
Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Dominicans, and Panamanians; they are spread out
throughout the borough. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are predominant in
Bushwick, Williamsburg, and East New York, while Mexicans are predominant in
Sunset Park and Panamanians in Crown Heights.

#### Russian and Ukrainian American[edit]

Main article: Russian Americans in New York City

Brooklyn is also home to many Russians and Ukrainians, who are mainly
concentrated in the areas of Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay. Brighton Beach
features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed _Little
Russia_ and _LittleOdessa_ , respectively. Originally these communities were
mostly Jewish; however, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of
Brighton Beach now also represent various aspects of Russian and Ukrainian
culture.

#### Polish American[edit]

Brooklyn's Polish are largely concentrated in Greenpoint, which is home to
Little Poland. They are also scattered throughout the southern parts of
Brooklyn.

#### Italian American[edit]

Main article: Italians in New York City

Italian Americans are mainly concentrated in the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst,
Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Gravesend, Cobble Hill, and Carroll
Gardens where there are many Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens,
pizzerie, cafes, and social clubs.

#### Muslim American[edit]

Today, Arab Americans and Pakistani Americans along with other Muslim
communities have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to
Bay Ridge, where there are many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges,
halal shops, Islamic shops and mosques. Coney Island Avenue is home to
_LittlePakistan_ as Church Avenue is to Bangladeshis. Jay Street Borough Hall
(Downtown Brooklyn) is little Arabia. Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated
every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue. Earlier, the area
was known predominately for its Irish, Norwegian, and Scottish populations.
There are also many Middle Eastern, particularly Yemeni, businesses, mosques,
and restaurants on Atlantic Avenue west of Flatbush Avenue, in Boerum Hill.

####  Irish American[edit]

Irish Americans can be found throughout Brooklyn, in low to moderate
concentrations in the neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Marine Park, Gerritsen
Beach, and Vinegar Hill. Many moved east on Long Island in the mid-twentieth
century.

#### Greek American[edit]

Brooklyn's Greek Americans live throughout the borough, but their businesses
today are concentrated in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue. Greek-owned
diners are also found throughout the borough, but many Greeks have re-located
off of Atlantic Avenue due to demographic shift.

#### Same-sex couples[edit]

Main article: Same-sex marriage in New York

Brooklyn is home to a large and growing population of same-sex couples. Same-
sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized
to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.[71] The Park Slope neighborhood
spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and numerous
neighborhoods have since become home to LGBTQ communities.

#### Artists-in-residence[edit]

Brooklyn became a preferred site for artists and hipsters to set up live/work
spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in
Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, DUMBO,
Red Hook, and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for artists-in-
residence. However, rents and costs of living have since increased
dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat
less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to
locales in New Jersey, such as Jersey City or Hoboken.[72]

## Government and politics[edit]

See also: Government and politics in Brooklyn

Brooklyn Borough Hall

Since consolidation with New York City in 1898, Brooklyn has been governed by
the New York City Charter that provides for a "strong" mayor-council system.
The centralized government of New York City is responsible for public
education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities,
sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. On the other hand, the
Brooklyn Public Library is an independent nonprofit organization partially
funded by the government of New York City, but also by the government of New
York State, the U.S. federal government, and private donors.

The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to
balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a
powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City
Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's
budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the Supreme Court of the United
States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the
most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board
than Staten Island, the least populous borough; it was a violation of the high
court's 1964 "one man, one vote" reading of the Fourteenth Amendment.[73]

Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at
the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and
corporations. Brooklyn's current Borough President is Eric Adams, elected as a
Democrat in November 2013 with 90.8% of the vote. Adams replaced popular
Borough President Marty Markowitz, also a Democrat, who partially used his
office to promote tourism and new development for Brooklyn.

The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices, and the borough is
very liberal. As of 2005, 69.7% of registered voters in Brooklyn were
Democrats. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education and
economic development. The most controversial political issue is the proposed
Atlantic Yards, a large housing and sports arena project. Pockets of majority
Republican influence exist in Gravesend, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights
and Midwood by U.S. Representative Dan Donovan and New York State Senator
Marty Golden.

Each of the city's five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own
criminal court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who
is directly elected by popular vote. The District Attorney of Kings County is
Eric Gonzalez, who replaced Democrat Kenneth P. Thompson following his death
in October 2016.[74] Brooklyn has 16 City Council members, the largest number
of any of the five boroughs. Brooklyn has 18 of the city's 59 community
districts, each served by an unpaid Community Board with advisory powers under
the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. Each board has a paid district
manager who acts as an interlocutor with city agencies.

## Economy[edit]

Brooklyn's job market is driven by three main factors: the performance of the
national and city economy, population flows and the borough's position as a
convenient back office for New York's businesses.[75]

Forty-four percent of Brooklyn's employed population, or 410,000 people, work
in the borough; more than half of the borough's residents work outside its
boundaries. As a result, economic conditions in Manhattan are important to the
borough's jobseekers. Strong international immigration to Brooklyn generates
jobs in services, retailing and construction.[75]

Since the late 20th century, Brooklyn has benefited from a steady influx of
financial back office operations from Manhattan, the rapid growth of a high-
tech and entertainment economy in DUMBO, and strong growth in support services
such as accounting, personal supply agencies, and computer services firms.[75]

Jobs in the borough have traditionally been concentrated in manufacturing, but
since 1975, Brooklyn has shifted from a manufacturing-based to a service-based
economy. In 2004, 215,000 Brooklyn residents worked in the services sector,
while 27,500 worked in manufacturing. Although manufacturing has declined, a
substantial base has remained in apparel and niche manufacturing concerns such
as furniture, fabricated metals, and food products.[76] The pharmaceutical
company Pfizer was founded in Brooklyn in 1869 and had a manufacturing plant
in the borough for many years that once employed thousands of workers, but the
plant shut down in 2008. However, new light-manufacturing concerns packaging
organic and high-end food have sprung up in the old plant.[77]

First established as a shipbuilding facility in 1801, the Brooklyn Navy Yard
employed 70,000 people at its peak during World War II and was then the
largest employer in the borough. The _Missouri_ , the ship on which the
Japanese formally surrendered, was built there, as was the _Maine_ , whose
sinking off Havana led to the start of the Spanish–American War. The iron-
sided Civil War vessel the _Monitor_ was built in Greenpoint. From 1968–1979
Seatrain Shipbuilding was the major employer.[78] Later tenants include
industrial design firms, food processing businesses, artisans, and the film
and television production industry. About 230 private-sector firms providing
4,000 jobs are at the Yard.

Construction and services are the fastest growing sectors.[79] Most employers
in Brooklyn are small businesses. In 2000, 91% of the approximately 38,704
business establishments in Brooklyn had fewer than 20 employees.[80] As of
August 2008[update], the borough's unemployment rate was 5.9%.[81]

Brooklyn is also home to many banks and credit unions. According to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, there were 37 banks and 26 credit
unions operating in the borough in 2010.[82][83]

The rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn has generated over US$10 billion of private
investment and $300 million in public improvements since 2004. Brooklyn is
also attracting numerous high technology start-up companies, as Silicon Alley,
the metonym for New York City's entrepreneurship ecosystem, has expanded from
Lower Manhattan into Brooklyn.[84]

Main article: Culture of Brooklyn

Brooklyn has played a major role in various aspects of American culture
including literature, cinema, and theater. The Brooklyn accent has often been
portrayed as the "typical New York accent" in American media, although this
accent and stereotype are supposedly fading out.[85] Brooklyn's official
colors are blue and gold.[86]

### Cultural venues[edit]

Brooklyn hosts the world-renowned Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn
Philharmonic, and the second largest public art collection in the United
States, housed in the Brooklyn Museum.

The Brooklyn Museum, opened in 1897, is New York City's second-largest public
art museum. It has in its permanent collection more than 1.5 million objects,
from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art. The Brooklyn
Children's Museum, the world's first museum dedicated to children, opened in
December 1899. The only such New York State institution accredited by the
American Alliance of Museums, it is one of the few globally to have a
permanent collection – over 30,000 cultural objects and natural history
specimens.

The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) includes a 2,109-seat opera house, an
874-seat theater, and the art house BAM Rose Cinemas. Bargemusic and St. Ann's
Warehouse are located on the other side of Downtown Brooklyn in the DUMBO arts
district. Brooklyn Technical High School has the second-largest auditorium in
New York City (after Radio City Music Hall), with a seating capacity of over
3,000.[87]

### Media[edit]

#### Local periodicals[edit]

Brooklyn has several local newspapers: The _Brooklyn Daily Eagle_ , _Bay
Currents_ (Oceanfront Brooklyn), _Brooklyn View_ , _The Brooklyn Paper_ , and
Courier-Life Publications. Courier-Life Publications, owned by Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation, is Brooklyn's largest chain of newspapers.
Brooklyn is also served by the major New York dailies, including _The New York
Times_ , the _New York Daily News_ , and the _New York Post_.

The borough is home to the bi-weekly cultural guide _The L Magazine_ and the
arts and politics monthly _Brooklyn Rail_ , as well as the arts and cultural
quarterly _Cabinet_. _Hello Mr._ is also published in Brooklyn.

_Brooklyn Magazine_ is one of the few glossy magazines about Brooklyn. Several
others, that are now defunct, include: _BKLYN Magazine_ (a bimonthly lifestyle
book owned by Joseph McCarthy, that saw itself as a vehicle for high-end
advertisers in Manhattan and was mailed to 80,000 high-income households),
_Brooklyn Bridge Magazine_ , _The Brooklynite_ (a free, glossy quarterly
edited by Daniel Treiman), and _NRG_ (edited by Gail Johnson and originally
marketed as a local periodical for Clinton Hill and Fort Greene, but expanded
in scope to become the self-proclaimed "Pulse of Brooklyn" and then the "Pulse
of New York").[88]

####  Ethnic press[edit]

Brooklyn has a thriving ethnic press. _El Diario La Prensa_ , the largest and
oldest Spanish-language daily newspaper in the United States, maintains its
corporate headquarters at 1 MetroTech Center in downtown Brooklyn.[89] Major
ethnic publications include the Brooklyn-Queens Catholic paper _The Tablet_ ,
_Hamodia_ , an Orthodox Jewish daily and _The Jewish Press_ , an Orthodox
Jewish weekly. Many nationally distributed ethnic newspapers are based in
Brooklyn. Over 60 ethnic groups, writing in 42 languages, publish some 300
non-English language magazines and newspapers in New York City. Among them the
quarterly "L'Idea", a bilingual magazine printed in Italian and English since
1974. In addition, many newspapers published abroad, such as _The Daily
Gleaner_ and _The Star_ of Jamaica, are available in Brooklyn. [ _citation
needed_ ] Our Time Press published weekly by DBG Media covers the Village of
Brooklyn with a motto of "The Local paper with the Global View".

#### Television[edit]

The City of New York has an official television station, run by the NYC Media
Group, which features programming based in Brooklyn. Brooklyn Community Access
Television is the borough's public access channel.[ _citation needed_ ]

### Events[edit]

  * The annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade (mid-to-late June) is a costume-and-float parade.[90]
  * Coney Island also hosts the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest (July 4).[90]
  * The annual Labor Day Carnival (also known as the Labor Day Parade or West Indian Day Parade) takes place along Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights.
  * The Art of Brooklyn Film Festival runs annually around the second week of June.[91]

  * Brooklyn Botanic Garden: located adjacent to Prospect Park is the 52-acre (21 ha) botanical garden, which includes a cherry tree esplanade, a one-acre (0.4 ha) rose garden, a Japanese hill and pond garden, a fragrance garden, a water lily pond esplanade, several conservatories, a rock garden, a native flora garden, a _bonsai_ tree collection, and children's gardens and discovery exhibits.
  * Coney Island developed as a playground for the rich in the early 1900s, but it grew as one of America's first amusement grounds and attracted crowds from all over New York. The Cyclone rollercoaster, built in 1927, is on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1920 Wonder Wheel and other rides are still operational. Coney Island went into decline in the 1970s, but has undergone a renaissance.[92]
  * Floyd Bennett Field: the first municipal airport in New York City and long closed for operations, is now part of the National Park System. Many of the historic hangars and runways are still extant. Nature trails and diverse habitats are found within the park, including salt marsh and a restored area of shortgrass prairie that was once widespread on the Hempstead Plains.
  * Green-Wood Cemetery, founded by the social reformer Henry Evelyn Pierrepont[93] in 1838, is an early Rural cemetery. It is the burial ground of many notable New Yorkers.
  * Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge: a unique Federal wildlife refuge straddling the Brooklyn-Queens border, part of Gateway National Recreation Area
  * New York Transit Museum displays historical artifacts of Greater New York's subway, commuter rail, and bus systems; it is located at Court Street, a former Independent Subway System station in Brooklyn Heights on the Fulton Street Line.
  * Prospect Park is a public park in central Brooklyn encompassing 585 acres (2.37 km 2).[94] The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who created Manhattan's Central Park. Attractions include the Long Meadow, a 90-acre (36 ha) meadow, the Picnic House, which houses offices and a hall that can accommodate parties with up to 175 guests; Litchfield Villa, Prospect Park Zoo, the Boathouse, housing a visitors center and the first urban Audubon Center;[95] Brooklyn's only lake, covering 60 acres (24 ha); the Prospect Park Bandshell that hosts free outdoor concerts in the summertime; and various sports and fitness activities including seven baseball fields. Prospect Park hosts a popular annual Halloween Parade.

### Sports[edit]

Main article: Sports in Brooklyn

Barclays Center, located in Pacific Park within Prospect Heights, home of the
Nets and Islanders.

Brooklyn's major professional sports teams are the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the
NHL's New York Islanders. The Nets and Islanders moved into the borough in
2012 and 2015, respectively, and both play their home games at Barclays Center
in Prospect Heights. Previously, the Nets had played in Uniondale, New York
and in New Jersey, while the Islanders had played in Uniondale since their
inception.

Brooklyn also has a storied sports history. It has been home to many famous
sports figures such as Joe Paterno, Vince Lombardi, Mike Tyson, Joe Torre, and
Vitas Gerulaitis. Basketball legend Michael Jordan was born in Brooklyn though
he grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina.

In the earliest days of organized baseball, Brooklyn teams dominated the new
game. The second recorded game of baseball was played near what is today Fort
Greene Park on October 24, 1845. Brooklyn’s Excelsiors, Atlantics and Eckfords
were the leading teams from the mid-1850s through the Civil War, and there
were dozens of local teams with neighborhood league play, such as at Mapleton
Oval.[96] During this "Brooklyn era", baseball evolved into the modern game:
the first fastball, first changeup, first batting average, first triple play,
first pro baseball player, first enclosed ballpark, first scorecard, first
known African-American team, first black championship game, first road trip,
first gambling scandal, and first eight pennant winners were all in or from
Brooklyn.[97]

Brooklyn's most famous historical team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, named for
"trolley dodgers" played at Ebbets Field.[98] In 1947 Jackie Robinson was
hired by the Dodgers as the first African-American player in Major League
Baseball in the modern era. In 1955, the Dodgers, perennial National League
pennant winners, won the only World Series for Brooklyn against their rival
New York Yankees. The event was marked by mass euphoria and celebrations. Just
two years later, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Walter O'Malley, the team's
owner at the time, is still vilified, even by Brooklynites too young to
remember the Dodgers as Brooklyn's ball club.

After a 43-year hiatus, professional baseball returned to the borough in 2001
with the Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor league team that plays in MCU Park in
Coney Island. They are an affiliate of the New York Mets. The New York Cosmos
of the NASL began playing at MCU Park in 2017.[99]

Brooklyn once had a National Football League team named the Brooklyn Lions in
1926, who played at Ebbets Field.[100]

## Transportation[edit]

### Public transport[edit]

See also: Transportation in New York City

About 57 percent of all households in Brooklyn were households without
automobiles. The citywide rate is 55 percent in New York City.[101]

Coney Island – Stillwell Avenue subway station

Brooklyn features extensive public transit. Nineteen New York City Subway
services, including the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, traverse the borough.
Approximately 92.8% of Brooklyn residents traveling to Manhattan use the
subway, despite the fact that some neighborhoods like Flatlands and Marine
Park are poorly served by subway service. Major stations, out of the 170
currently in Brooklyn, include:

  * Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center
  * Broadway Junction
  * DeKalb Avenue
  * Jay Street – MetroTech
  * Coney Island – Stillwell Avenue[102]

Proposed New York City Subway lines never built include a line along Nostrand
or Utica Avenues to Marine Park,[103] as well as a subway line to Spring
Creek.[104][105]

Brooklyn was once served by an extensive network of streetcars, many of which
were replaced by the public bus network that covers the entire borough. There
is also daily express bus service into Manhattan.[106] New York's famous
yellow cabs also provide transportation in Brooklyn, although they are less
numerous in the borough. There are three commuter rail stations in Brooklyn:
East New York, Nostrand Avenue, and Atlantic Terminal, the terminus of the
Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The terminal is located near the
Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center subway station, with ten connecting subway
services.

In February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government
would begin a citywide ferry service called NYC Ferry to extend ferry
transportation to communities in the city that have been traditionally
undeserved by public transit.[107][108] The ferry opened in May
2017,[109][110] with the Bay Ridge ferry serving southwestern Brooklyn and the
East River Ferry serving northwestern Brooklyn. A third route, the Rockaway
ferry, makes one stop in the borough at Brooklyn Army Terminal.[111]

A streetcar line, the Brooklyn–Queens Connector, was proposed by the city in
February 2016,[112] with the planned timeline calling for service to begin
around 2024.[113]

### Roadways[edit]

Island City in background

The great majority of limited-access expressways and parkways are located in
the western and southern sections of Brooklyn. These include the Brooklyn-
Queens Expressway, the Gowanus Expressway (which is part of the Brooklyn-
Queens Expressway), the Prospect Expressway (New York State Route 27), the
Belt Parkway, and the Jackie Robinson Parkway (formerly the Interborough
Parkway). Planned expressways that were never built include the Bushwick
Expressway, an extension of I-78[114] and the Cross-Brooklyn Expressway,
I-878.[115] Major thoroughfares include Atlantic Avenue, Fourth Avenue, 86th
Street, Kings Highway, Bay Parkway, Ocean Parkway, Eastern Parkway, Linden
Boulevard, McGuinness Boulevard, Flatbush Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and
Nostrand Avenue.

Much of Brooklyn has only named streets, but Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Sunset
Park, Bensonhurst, and Borough Park and the other western sections have
numbered streets running approximately northwest to southeast, and numbered
avenues going approximately northeast to southwest. East of Dahill Road,
lettered avenues (like Avenue M) run east and west, and numbered streets have
the prefix "East". South of Avenue O, related numbered streets west of Dahill
Road use the "West" designation. This set of numbered streets ranges from West
37th Street to East 108 Street, and the avenues range from A-Z with names
substituted for some of them in some neighborhoods (notably Albemarle,
Beverley, Cortelyou, Dorchester, Ditmas, Foster, Farragut, Glenwood, Quentin).
Numbered streets prefixed by "North" and "South" in Williamsburg, and "Bay",
"Beach", "Brighton", "Plumb", "Paerdegat" or "Flatlands" along the southern
and southwestern waterfront are loosely based on the old grids of the original
towns of Kings County that eventually consolidated to form Brooklyn. These
names often reflect the bodies of water or beaches around them, such as Plumb
Beach or Paerdegat Basin.

Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by three bridges, the Brooklyn, Manhattan,
and Williamsburg bridges; a vehicular tunnel, the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel
(formerly the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel); and several subway tunnels. The
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge links Brooklyn with the more suburban borough of
Staten Island. Though much of its border is on land, Brooklyn shares several
water crossings with Queens, including the Kosciuszko Bridge (part of the
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway), the Pulaski Bridge, and the JJ Byrne Memorial
Bridge, all of which carry traffic over Newtown Creek, and the Marine Parkway
Bridge connecting Brooklyn to the Rockaway Peninsula.

### Waterways[edit]

Brooklyn was long a major shipping port, especially at the Brooklyn Army
Terminal in Sunset Park. Most container ship cargo operations have shifted to
the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, while the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in
Red Hook is a focal point for New York's growing cruise industry. The _Queen
Mary 2_ , one of the world's largest ocean liners, was designed specifically
to fit under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in
the United States. She makes regular ports of call at the Red Hook terminal on
her transatlantic crossings from Southampton, England.

[116]

In February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government
would begin NYC Ferry to extend ferry transportation to traditionally
underserved communities in the city.[117][108] The ferry opened in May
2017,[118][119] offering commuter services from the western shore of Brooklyn
to Manhattan via three routes. The East River Ferry serves points in Lower
Manhattan, Midtown, Long Island City, and northwestern Brooklyn via its East
River route. The South Brooklyn and Rockaway routes serve southwestern
Brooklyn before terminating in lower Manhattan.[116] NY Waterway offers tours
and charters. SeaStreak also offers weekday ferry service between the Brooklyn
Army Terminal and the Manhattan ferry slips at Pier 11 downtown and East 34th
Street in midtown. A Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, originally proposed in the
1920s as a core project for the then new Port Authority of New York is again
being studied and discussed as a way to ease freight movements across a large
swath of the metropolitan area.

## Education[edit]

See also: Education in New York City and List of high schools in New York City

Education in Brooklyn is provided by a vast number of public and private
institutions. Public schools in the borough are managed by the New York City
Department of Education, the largest public school system.

Brooklyn Technical High School (commonly called Brooklyn Tech), a New York
City public high school, is the largest specialized high school for science,
mathematics, and technology in the United States.[120] Brooklyn Tech opened in
1922. Brooklyn Tech is located across the street from Fort Greene Park. This
high school was built from 1930 to 1933 at a cost of about $6,000,000 and is
12 stories high. It covers about half of a city block.[121] Brooklyn Tech is
noted for its famous alumni[122] (including two Nobel Laureates), its
academics, and the large number of graduates attending prestigious
universities.

### Higher education[edit]

#### Public colleges[edit]

Brooklyn College is a senior college of the City University of New York, and
was the first public coeducational liberal arts college in New York City. The
College ranked in the top 10 nationally for the second consecutive year in
Princeton Review’s 2006 guidebook, _America’s Best Value Colleges_. Many of
its students are first and second generation Americans.

Founded in 1970, Medgar Evers College is a senior college of the City
University of New York, with a mission to develop and maintain high quality,

east of Prospect Park in Crown Heights.

CUNY's New York City College of Technology (City Tech) of The City University
of New York (CUNY) (Downtown Brooklyn/Brooklyn Heights) is the largest public
college of technology in New York State and a national model for technological
education. Established in 1946, City Tech can trace its roots to 1881 when the
Technical Schools of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were renamed the New York
Trade School. That institution—which became the Voorhees Technical Institute
many decades later—was soon a model for the development of technical and
vocational schools worldwide. In 1971, Voorhees was incorporated into City
Tech.

SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, founded as the Long Island College
Hospital in 1860, is the oldest hospital-based medical school in the United
States. The Medical Center comprises the College of Medicine, College of
Health Related Professions, College of Nursing, School of Public Health,
School of Graduate Studies, and University Hospital of Brooklyn. The Nobel
Prize winner Robert F. Furchgott was a member of its faculty. Half of the
Medical Center's students are minorities or immigrants. The College of
Medicine has the highest percentage of minority students of any medical school
in New York State.

#### Private colleges[edit]

Robert A. M. Stern

Brooklyn Law School was founded in 1901 and is notable for its diverse student
body. Women and African Americans were enrolled in 1909. According to the
Leiter Report, a compendium of law school rankings published by Brian Leiter,
Brooklyn Law School places 31st nationally for quality of students.[123]

Long Island University is a private university headquartered in Brookville on
Long Island, with a campus in Downtown Brooklyn with 6,417 undergraduate
students. The Brooklyn campus has strong science and medical technology
programs, at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

programs in engineering, architecture, and the arts. Some buildings in the
school's Brooklyn campus are official landmarks. Pratt has over 4700 students,
with most at its Brooklyn campus. Graduate programs include library and
information science, architecture, and urban planning. Undergraduate programs
include architecture, construction management, writing, critical and visual
studies, industrial design and fine arts, totaling over 25 programs in all.

NYU Tandon Wunsch Building

The New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the United States'
second oldest private institute of technology, founded in 1854, has its main
campus in Downtown's MetroTech Center, a commercial, civic and educational
redevelopment project of which it was a key sponsor. NYU-Tandon is one of the
18 schools and colleges that comprise New York University
(NYU).[124][125][126][127]

St. Francis College is a Catholic college located in Brooklyn Heights and was
founded in 1859 by Franciscan friars. Today, there are over 2,400 students
attending the small liberal arts college. St. Francis is considered by _The
New York Times_ as one of the more diverse colleges, and was ranked one of the
best baccalaureate colleges by both _Forbes_ magazine and _U.S. News & World
Report_.[128][129][130]

Brooklyn also has smaller liberal arts institutions, such as Saint Joseph's
College in Clinton Hill and Boricua College in Williamsburg.

#### Community colleges[edit]

Kingsborough Community College is a junior college in the City University of
New York system, located in Manhattan Beach.

## Brooklyn Public Library[edit]

The Central Library at Grand Army Plaza.

As an independent system, separate from the New York and Queens public library
systems, the Brooklyn Public Library[131] offers thousands of public programs,
millions of books, and use of more than 850 free Internet-accessible
computers. It also has books and periodicals in all the major languages spoken
in Brooklyn, including English, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Hebrew, and Haitian
Creole, as well as French, Yiddish, Hindi, Bengali, Polish, Italian, and
Arabic. The Central Library is a landmarked building facing Grand Army Plaza.

There are 58 library branches, placing one within a half mile of each Brooklyn
resident. In addition to its specialized Business Library in Brooklyn Heights,
the Library is preparing to construct its new Visual & Performing Arts Library
(VPA) in the BAM Cultural District, which will focus on the link between new
and emerging arts and technology and house traditional and digital
collections. It will provide access and training to arts applications and
technologies not widely available to the public. The collections will include
the subjects of art, theater, dance, music, film, photography and
architecture. A special archive will house the records and history of
Brooklyn's arts communities.
