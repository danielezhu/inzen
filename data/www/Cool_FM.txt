97.4 Cool FM is a commercial radio station, based in Newtownards, Northern Ireland. The station is owned and operated by Bauer Radio and forms part of Bauer's City network of stations.
The station began broadcasting in 1990 when its parent station Downtown Radio ceased simulcasting and split its AM and FM frequencies into two separate services. Downtown Radio continued on 1026 kHz AM and on some FM frequencies and Cool FM was created to broadcast on the 97.4 MHz FM frequency, initially in the Greater Belfast area only.
Cool FM usually plays chart and contemporary hit music, but also features some specialised hours such as Cool of Rock on weekday mornings and Cool Goes Quiet (easy listening classics) on Monday - Thursday nights. The station's Newtownards studios are based on the Kiltonga industrial estate.
