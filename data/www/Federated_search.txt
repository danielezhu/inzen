Federated search is an information retrieval technology that allows the simultaneous search of multiple searchable resources. A user makes a single query request which is distributed to the search engines, databases or other query engines participating in the federation. The federated search then aggregates the results that are received from the search engines for presentation to the user.
This is often a technique to integrate disparate information resources on the web. It can also be a technique to integrate multiple data sources within a large organization or "enterprise."
