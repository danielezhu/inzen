Absolute Radio 90s is a spin-off service from Absolute Radio. Like Absolute 80s, this DAB spin-off service is a rolling music service which plays music from the 1990s. Some of the artists which feature on the service include Blur, Oasis, The Chemical Brothers, Guns and Roses, Portishead, The Stone Roses, Radiohead and Primal Scream amongst others.
The station launched on DAB Digital Radio in London in June 2010 and on the Digital One platform on 25 August 2010 and was initially available for one month as a 'test'. However, the availability of the station nationally continued beyond the end of September, and after a strong opening Rajar figure, it was confirmed that the 90s service would continue to be available on Digital One. It remained on that multiplex until January 2015 when its slot was given over to Magic. Ahead of this change Absolute 90s began appearing on a number of local DAB ensembles from 12 December 2014, replacing Kerrang! Radio in many cases. Absolute 90s continues to broadcast nationally via satellite TV and online.
