Filles de Kilimanjaro (French for "Girls of Kilimanjaro") is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. It was recorded in June and September 1968. The album was released in the United Kingdom by Columbia (CBS) in 1968, and in the United States in February 1969.
The album is a transitional work for Davis, who was shifting stylistically from acoustic recordings with his second "great" quintet to his "electric" period. Filles de Kilimanjaro was well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a significant release in modern jazz.
