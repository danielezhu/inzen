"Bird Gets the Worm" is a composition by alto saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker. Like many of Parker's compositions, this tune features an original melody composed by Parker, superimposed over the chord changes from a popular tune: in this case "Lover Come Back to Me". Parker only made one recording of this song, which was at 340 beats per minute, making one of his fastest and most memorable recordings.. It was released in 1949 as a 10" 78 RPM single b/w Cheryl on Savoy Records 952A.
This composition appears on Cool Bird, a compilation of 1947 recordings featuring Bird accompanied by Miles Davis (trumpet), Duke Jordan (piano), Tommy Potter (bass) and Max Roach (drums), all of whom have a solo on this track.
