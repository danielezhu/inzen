Absolute Radio 70s is a British radio station dedicated to music from the 1970s. Launched by Absolute Radio to complement their decade format radio stations, it first aired on 29 November 2011, debuting a week after Absolute Radio 60s. The station broadcasts through DAB on the Switch London multiplex in the Greater London area, and is also available online, where it can be accessed using Radioplayer. Absolute Radio 70s went on air in November 2011, and was the first UK radio station to be dedicated solely to music from the decade, but it was followed a month later by the similarly themed Smooth 70s, which launched nationally on the DAB multiplex.
