The Latino-Faliscan languages are a group of languages that belong to the Italic language family of the Indo-European languages. They were spoken in Italy. Latin and Faliscan belong to this group, as well as two others often considered to be archaic Latin dialects, Lanuvian and Praenestine.
Latin eventually absorbed the others, replacing Faliscan as the power of the Romans expanded. The only member of the group to survive extinction was Latin. Latin, in turn, developed into the Romance languages, which are now spoken by more than 800 million people worldwide.
