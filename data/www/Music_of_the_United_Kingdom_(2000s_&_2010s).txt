Popular music of the United Kingdom in the 2000s continued to expand and develop new subgenres and fusions. While talent show contestants were one of the major forces in pop music, British soul maintained and even extended its high profile with figures like Joss Stone, Estelle, Duffy and Adele, while a new group of singer/songwriters led by Amy Winehouse achieved international success. New forms of dance music emerged, including grime and dubstep. There was also a revival of garage rock and post punk, which when mixed with electronic music produced new rave.
