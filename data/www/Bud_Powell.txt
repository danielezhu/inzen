Earl Rudolph "Bud" Powell (September 27, 1924 â€“ July 31, 1966) was an American jazz pianist, born and raised in Harlem, New York City. Though Thelonious Monk was a close friend and influence, his greatest piano influence was Art Tatum.
Along with Charlie Parker, Monk, and Dizzy Gillespie, Powell was a leading figure in the development of modern jazz, or bebop. His virtuosity led many to call him the Charlie Parker of the piano. Powell was also a composer, and many jazz critics credit his works and his playing as having "greatly extended the range of jazz harmony."
