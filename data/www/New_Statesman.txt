The New Statesman is a British political and cultural magazine published in London. Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other leading members of the socialist Fabian Society.
The magazine, which today is a print-digital hybrid, has, according to its present self-description, a liberal, sceptical political position.
The longest-serving editor was Kingsley Martin (1930â€“60). The current editor is Jason Cowley, who assumed the post at the end of September 2008. The magazine has notably recognized and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers. Its contributors have included John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Hitchens, and Paul Johnson.
Historically, the magazine was sometimes affectionately referred to as "The Staggers" because of crises in funding, ownership and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog. Its regular writers, critics and columnists include Mehdi Hasan, Will Self, John Gray, Laurie Penny, Ed Smith, Stephen Bush, Rowan Williams, Brendan Simms, John Bew, Shiraz Maher and Helen Lewis, the deputy editor. Circulation peaked in the mid-1960s but has surged in recent years. The magazine had a certified average circulation of 34,025 in 2016, a 35-year high. Traffic to the magazine's website reached a new record high in June 2016, with 27 million page views and four million unique users.
In September 2014, as part of its digital expansion, the magazine launched two new websites, the urbanism-focused CityMetric and May2015.com, a data and polling site.
