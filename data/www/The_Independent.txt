The Independent is a British online newspaper. Established in 1986 as an independent national morning newspaper published in London, it was controlled by Tony O'Reilly's Independent News & Media from 1997 until it was sold to Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev in 2010. The printed edition of the paper ceased in March 2016.
Nicknamed the Indy, it began as a broadsheet, but changed to tabloid (compact) format in 2003. Until September 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as "free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence". It tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues.
The daily edition was named National Newspaper of the Year at the 2004 British Press Awards.
In June 2015, it had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85 per cent down from its 1990 peak, while the Sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000. The last print edition of The Independent on Sunday was published on 20 March 2016, with the main paper ceasing print publication the following Saturday, leaving only its digital editions.
