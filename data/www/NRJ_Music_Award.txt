The awards ceremony, created in 2000 by NRJ in partnership with the television network TF1, traditionally took place every year in mid-January at Cannes (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France) as the opening of MIDEM (Marché international de l'édition musicale). It is now held in the month of November. They give out awards to popular musicians in different categories.
The name "NRJ" means "Nouvelle Radio des Jeunes" (new radio of teens). It is a play on words between the pronunciation of the French letters and the French word "énergie" (energy).
