**Pennsylvania** (/ ˌpɛnsɪlˈveɪniə/ ( listen); Pennsylvania German:
_Pennsylvaani_ or _Pennsilfaani_ ), officially the **Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania** , is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its
middle. The Commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the
south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the
Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New
Jersey to the east.

Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest, the 5th-most populous, and the 9th-most
densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's five most populous
cities are Philadelphia (1,560,297), Pittsburgh (305,801), Allentown
(118,577), Erie (100,671), and Reading (89,893). The state capital, and its
ninth-largest city, is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 140 miles (225 km) of
shoreline along Lake Erie and the Delaware Estuary.[8]

The state is one of the 13 original founding states of the United States; it
came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the
son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River),
together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the
Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States
Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where the United States
Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is
located in the state's largest city of Philadelphia. During the American Civil
War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the
state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters
during the bitter winter of 1777–78.

Counties of Pennsylvania

World's End State Park, Sullivan County

Pennsylvania is 170 miles (274 km) north to south and 283 miles (455 km) east
to west.[9] Of a total 46,055 square miles (119,282 km2), 44,817 square miles
(116,075 km2) are land, 490 square miles (1,269 km2) are inland waters, and
749 square miles (1,940 km2) are waters in Lake Erie.[10] It is the 33rd-
largest state in the United States.[11] Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km)[12]
of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[8] of shoreline along the
Delaware Estuary.

The boundaries of the state are the Mason–Dixon line (39° 43' N) to the south,
the Twelve-Mile Circle on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the Delaware River
to the east, 80° 31' W to the west and the 42° N to the north, with the
exception of a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends
north to Lake Erie.

Cities include Philadelphia, Reading, Lebanon and Lancaster in the southeast,
Pittsburgh in the southwest, the tri-cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and
Easton in the central east (known as the Lehigh Valley). The northeast
includes the former anthracite coal mining communities of Scranton, Wilkes-
Barre, Pittston City (Greater Pittston), and Hazleton. Erie is located in the
northwest. Williamsport serves as the commonwealth's north-central region,
with York and the state capital Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River in the
east-central region of the Commonwealth and Altoona and Johnstown in the west-
central region.

The state has 5 regions, namely the Allegheny Plateau, Ridge and Valley,
Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Erie Plain.

## Climate[edit]

Köppen climate types of Pennsylvania

Autumn in North Branch Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania

Main article: Climate of Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, though
the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two
major zones, the majority of the state, with the exception of the southeastern
corner, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification _Dfa_
). The largest city, Philadelphia, has some characteristics of the humid
subtropical climate (Köppen _Cfa_ ) that covers much of Delaware and Maryland
to the south.

Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate
becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increase, and snowfall amounts are
greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near Lake Erie,
can receive over 100 inches (250 cm) of snowfall annually, and the entire
state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be
subject to severe weather from spring through summer into fall. Tornadoes
occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded
tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these are not really damaging.[13]

## History[edit]

Main article: History of Pennsylvania

people from Pennsylvania

Long before the Commonwealth was visited and later settled by Europeans, the
area was home to subgroups of the Delaware (also known as Lenni Lenape),
Susquehannock, Iroquois, Eriez, Shawnee, and still other American Indian
Nations of uncertain designation. The Tuscarora Nation took up temporary
residence in the central portion of Pennsylvania ca. 1715–55.[19]

### 17th century[edit]

Both the Dutch and the English claimed both sides of the Delaware River as
part of their colonial lands in America.[20][21][22] The Dutch were the first
to take possession.[22]

By June 3, 1631, the Dutch had begun settling the Delmarva Peninsula by
establishing the Zwaanendael Colony on the site of present-day Lewes,
Delaware.[23] In 1638, Sweden established the New Sweden Colony, in the region
of Fort Christina, on the site of present-day Wilmington, Delaware. New Sweden
claimed and, for the most part, controlled the lower Delaware River region
(parts of present-day Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few
colonists there.[24][25]

_Penn's Treaty with the Indians_ , by Edward Hicks

On March 12, 1664, King Charles II of England gave James, Duke of York a grant
that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of
Plymouth Grant plus other lands. This grant was in conflict with the Dutch
claim for New Netherland, which included parts of today's Pennsylvania.[26]

On June 24, 1664, the Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that
included present-day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a
proprietary colony. The land was not yet in British possession, but the sale
boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the Delaware River.
The British conquest of New Netherland began on August 29, 1664, when New
Amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on British ships in
New York Harbor.[27][28] This conquest continued, and was completed in October
1664, when the British captured Fort Casimir in what today is New Castle,
Delaware.

John Dickinson

The Peace of Breda between England, France and the Netherlands confirmed the
English conquest on July 21, 1667,[29][30] although there were temporary
reversions.

On September 12, 1672, as part of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch re-
conquered New York Colony/New Amsterdam, the Dutch established three County
Courts which went on to become original Counties in present-day Delaware and
Pennsylvania. The one that later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland.[31]
This was partially reversed on February 9, 1674, when the Treaty of
Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and reverted all political
situations to the _status quo ante bellum_. The British retained the Dutch
Counties with their Dutch names.[32] By June 11, 1674, New York reasserted
control over the outlying colonies, including Upland, but the names started to
be changed to British names by November 11, 1674.[33] Upland was partitioned
on November 12, 1674, producing the general outline of the current border
between Pennsylvania and Delaware.[34]

On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[35] to William Penn to
repay a debt of £16,000[36] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail
inflation)[37] owed to William's father, Admiral William Penn. This was one of
the largest land grants to an individual in history.[38] The King named it
Pennsylvania (literally "Penn's Woods") in honor of the Admiral. Penn, the
son, who wanted it to be called New Wales, and then Sylvania (from the Latin
_silva_ : "forest, woods"), was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people
would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename
the grant.[39] Penn established a government with two innovations that were
much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious
conviction.[38]

townships and lotts

What had been Upland on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania-
Delaware Border was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted
their colonial governments on March 4, 1681.[40][41] The Quaker leader William
Penn had signed a peace treaty with Tammany, leader of the Delaware tribe,
beginning a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the
Indians.[42] Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed.
The treaty of William Penn was never violated.[43]

### 18th century[edit]

Between 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of
1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the
shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called Colonial Scrip.
The Colony issued "bills of credit", which were as good as gold or silver
coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the
government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition,
largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the
people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the
Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency.
Benjamin Franklin had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its
utility was never to be disputed, and it also met with the "cautious approval"
of Adam Smith.[44]

James Smith wrote that in 1763, "the Indians again commenced hostilities, and
were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in
various parts of Pennsylvania." Further, "This state was then a Quaker
government, and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance
from the state."[45] The ensuing hostilities became known as Pontiac's War.

President's House (Philadelphia). The Masters-Penn mansion housed
Pennsylvania's governor in the early 1770s. It later served as the
presidential mansion of George Washington and John Adams, 1790–1800, while
Philadelphia was the temporary national capital.

After the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, Delegate John Dickinson of Philadelphia
wrote the _Declaration of Rights and Grievances_. The Congress was the first
meeting of the Thirteen Colonies, called at the request of the Massachusetts
Assembly, but only nine colonies sent delegates.[46] Dickinson then wrote
_Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, To the Inhabitants of the British
Colonies_ , which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle between
December 2, 1767, and February 15, 1768.[47]

When the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in
1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress.[48]
The Second Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775),
drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia,[49] but
when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped
westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 1777,
and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, drew up
the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new
nation. Later, the Constitution was written, and Philadelphia was once again
chosen to be cradle to the new American Nation.[50] The Constitution was
drafted and signed at the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence
Hall, and the same building where the Declaration of Independence was
signed.[51]

Pennsylvania became the first large state, and the second state to ratify the
U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787,[52] five days after Delaware became
the first. At the time it was the most ethically and religiously diverse of
the Thirteen Colonies. Because One-third of Pennsylvania’s population spoke
German, the Constitution was presented in German to include those citizens in
the discussion. Reverend Frederick Muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the
state's ratifying convention.[53]

Dickinson College of Carlisle was the first college founded in the United
States. Established in 1773, the college was ratified five days after the
Treaty of Paris on September 9, 1783. The school was founded by Benjamin Rush
and named after John Dickinson.

The "Hills Capitol", used from 1821 until it burned down in 1897.

For half a century, the Commonwealth's General Assembly (legislature) met at
various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet
regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years.[54] But it needed
a more central location, as for example the Paxton Boys massacres of 1763 had
made the legislature aware. So, in 1799 the General Assembly moved to the
Lancaster Courthouse,[54] and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg.[54]

### 19th century[edit]

The General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December
1821,[54] when the Federal-style "Hills Capitol" (named for its builder,
Stephen Hills, a Lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land grant
of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient,
entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris, Sr., a Yorkshire native who
had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore of the
Susquehanna River.[55] The Hills Capitol burned down on February 2, 1897,
during a heavy snowstorm, presumably because of a faulty flue.[54] The General
Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still standing) until
a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural selection contest
that many alleged had been "rigged", Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was
charged with designing and building a replacement building; however, the
legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and a roughly
finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was completed. The
General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political and popular
indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to
Pennsylvania architects, and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was chosen
to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated Cobb's
building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.[54]

The new state Capitol drew rave reviews.[54] Its dome was inspired by the
domes of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol.[54]
President Theodore Roosevelt called it "the most beautiful state Capital in
the nation" and said, "It's the handsomest building I ever saw" at the
dedication. In 1989, _The New York Times_ praised it as "grand, even awesome
at moments, but it is also a working building, accessible to citizens ... a
building that connects with the reality of daily life".[54]

James Buchanan, of Franklin County, the only bachelor President of the United
States,[56] was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania. The Battle of
Gettysburg—the major turning point of the Civil War—took place near
Gettysburg.[57] An estimated 350,000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army
forces including 8,600 African American military volunteers.

Pennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. In
1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the
well, which led to the first major oil boom in United States history.

At the beginning of the 20th century Pennsylvania's economy centered on steel
production, logging, coal mining, textile production and other forms of
industrial manufacturing. A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late
19th and early 20th centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these
industries which often employed children and people who could not speak
English.

In 1923 President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest
under the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911 in the northwest part of the
state in Elk, Forest, McKean, and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber
production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin. The
Allegheny is the state's only national forest.

##  Demographics[edit]

Further information: List of people from Pennsylvania

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Pennsylvania
was 12,802,503 on July 1, 2015, a 0.79% increase since the 2010 United States
Census. In an earlier estimate, the state was 78.8% Non-Hispanic White, 11.4%
Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.0% Asian, 0.1% Native
Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.7% Two or More Races, and 6.1% Hispanic
or Latino.[58]

Of the people residing in Pennsylvania, 74.5% were born in Pennsylvania, 18.4%
were born in a different U.S. state, 1.5% were born Puerto Rico, U.S. Island
areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5.6% were foreign born.[59]

According to the 2010 Census, 81.9% of the population was White (79.2% non-
Hispanic white), 11.3% was Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian and
Alaska Native, 2.9% Asian, 1.9% from two or more races. 5.9% of the total
population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).[60]

Two or more races | – | 1.2% | 1.9%  
  
As of 2011, 32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age one were
minorities.[64]

Pennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, making
it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The
significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the
state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent
from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and
South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York
and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population
swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese
immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from
New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the
largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and
African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in
that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio,
Illinois, and Michigan).The White population declined by 0.7%, a trend that is
beginning to reverse itself. Twelve other states saw decreases in their White
populations.[65] The state of Pennsylvania has a high in-migration of blacks
and Hispanics from other nearby states, with eastern and south-central
portions of the state seeing the bulk of the increases.[66][67]

The center of population of Pennsylvania is located in Perry County, in the
borough of Duncannon.[68]

State population from 1790 to 2000

Pennsylvania's population distribution

As of 2013, Pennsylvania has an estimated population of 12,773,801, which is
an increase of 10,265 from the previous year and an increase of 71,422 since
the year 2010. Net migration to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718,
and immigration from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net
migration to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians
resulted in a decrease of 100,000 people. From 2008 to 2012, 5.8% of the
population was foreign-born.[69] The state has an estimated 2005 poverty rate
of 12%.[70] The state also has the 3rd-highest proportion of elderly (65+)
citizens in 2005.[70]

Foreign born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), Europe (35.9%), and
Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa (5%), North America
(3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%).

The majority of Hispanics in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent, having
one of the largest and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the
country.[71][72] Most of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of
Mexicans and Dominicans. Most Hispanics are concentrated in Philadelphia,
Lehigh Valley and South Central Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's reported
population of Hispanics, especially among the Black race, has markedly
increased in recent years.[73] The Hispanic population is greatest in
Hazleton, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, York, and around Philadelphia. It is
not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much
reflects increased willingness to self-identify minority status. As of 2010,
it is estimated that about 85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a
150-mile (240 km) radius of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the
city itself.

Of the black population, the vast majority in the state are African American,
being descendants of African slaves brought to the US south during the
colonial era. There are also a growing number of blacks of West Indian, recent
African, and Hispanic origins.[74] Most blacks live in the Philadelphia area,
Pittsburgh, and South Central Pennsylvania, among other areas. Whites make-up
the majority of Pennsylvania, they are mostly descended from German, Irish,
Italian, and English immigrants, among others. Rural portions of South Central
Pennsylvania are famous nationwide for its notable Amish communities. The
"Wyoming Valley" or the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Metropolitan Area has a large
concentration of whites. As a matter of fact, it has the highest percentage of
white residents than any other metropolitan area in the U.S. with 96.2% of its
population claiming to be white with no Hispanic background.

Pennsylvania's population was reported as 5.9% under 5 and 23.8% under 18,
with 15.6% aged 65 or older. Women made up 52% of the population.[75] The
largest ancestry groups are listed below, expressed as a percentage of total
people who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010 census:[76][77]

  * 28.5% German
  * 18.2% Irish
  * 12.8% Italian
  * 9.6% African American
  * 8.5% English
  * 7.2% Polish
  * 4.2% French Canadian

#### Pennsylvania German language[edit]

Main article: Pennsylvania German language

Pennsylvania German is often—even though misleadingly—called "Pennsylvania
Dutch". The term "Dutch" used to mean "German"[83] (including the
Netherlands), before the Latin name for them replaced it (but stuck with the
Netherlands). When referring to the language spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch
people (Pennsylvania German) it means "German" or "Teutonic" rather than
"Netherlander". Germans, in their own language, call themselves "Deutsch",
(Pennsylvania German: "Deitsch"). The Pennsylvania German language is a
descendant of German, in the West Central German dialect family. It is closest
to Palatine German. Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first
language among Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites (principally in the
Lancaster County area), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language
outside the plain communities, though a few words have passed into English
usage.

Of all the colonies, only Rhode Island had religious freedom as secure as in
Pennsylvania.[85] Voltaire, writing of William Penn in 1733, observed: "The
new sovereign also enacted several wise and wholesome laws for his colony,
which have remained invariably the same to this day. The chief is, to
ill–treat no person on account of religion, and to consider as brethren all
those who believe in one God."[86] One result of this uncommon freedom was a
wide religious diversity, which continues to the present.

Pennsylvania's population in 2010 was 12,702,379. Of these, 6,838,440 (53.8%)
were estimated to belong to some sort of organized religion. According to the
Association of religion data archives (ARDA) at Pennsylvania State University,
the largest religions in Pennsylvania by adherents are the Roman Catholic
Church with 3,503,028 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 591,734
members, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 501,974 members.

The third-largest single denomination is the Presbyterian Church (USA) with
250,000 members and 1,011 congregations. Pennsylvania, especially western part
and Pittsburgh area has one of the highest percentage of Presbyterians in the
nation. The Presbyterian Church in America has also significant, 112
congregations and 23,000 adherents, the EPC has around 50 congregations, as
well as ECO. The next largest Protestant denomination, the United Church of
Christ, has 180,000 members and 627 congregations. American Baptist Churches
USA (Northern Baptist Convention) is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania was the center state of the German Reformed denomination since
the 1700s.[87] Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is one of the headquarters of the
Moravian Church in America. Pennsylvania also has a very large Amish
population, second only to Ohio among the states.[88] In the year 2000 there
was a total Amish population of 47,860 in Pennsylvania and a further 146,416
Mennonites and 91,200 Brethren. The total Anabapist population including
Bruderhof[89] was 232,631, about 2 percent of the population.[90] While
Pennsylvania owes its existence to Quakers, and much of the historic character
of the Commonwealth is ideologically rooted in the teachings of the Religious
Society of Friends (as they are officially known), practicing Quakers are a
small minority of about 10,000 adherents in 2010.[91]

As of 2014[update], the religious affiliations of the people of Pennsylvania
are:[84]

  * Christianity – 73% 
    * Protestant – 47% 
      * Mainline Protestant – 23%
      * Evangelical Protestant – 19%
      * Black Protestant – 5%
    * Roman Catholic – 29%
    * Jehovah's Witnesses – 1%
    * Orthodox Christian – <1%
  * Non-religious/Unaffiliated – 21%
  * Judaism – 1%
  * Islam - 1%
  * Hinduism – 1%
  * Other religions – 2%
  * Don't know/Refused to say – 1%

According to a 2012 Gallup poll, 40% of Pennsylvanians are very religious, 28%
are moderately religious, and 32% are non-religious.[92]

## Economy[edit]

Pennsylvania locations by per capita income

Pennsylvania was home of two of the largest steel producers in the world;
Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel and Bethlehem-based Bethlehem Steel. The former
blast furnace sites have either been destroyed, preserved, or in the case of
Bethlehem, became a new multi-million dollar Sands Casino Resort in 2009.

Pennsylvania's 2013 total gross state product (GSP) of $644 billion ranks the
state 6th in the nation.[93] If Pennsylvania were an independent country, its
economy would rank as the 18th-largest in the world. On a per-capita basis,
Pennsylvania's per-capita GSP of $47,274 (in chained 2009 dollars) ranks 26th
among the 50 states.[93]

2014 American Community Survey 5-year estimate.

Philadelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest corner, Erie
in the northwest corner, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre in the northeast corner, and
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton in the east central region are urban manufacturing
centers. Much of the Commonwealth is rural; this dichotomy affects state
politics as well as the state economy.[94] Philadelphia is home to six Fortune
500 companies,[95] with more located in suburbs like King of Prussia; it is a
leader in the financial[96] and insurance industry.

Pittsburgh is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, including U.S. Steel, PPG
Industries, and H.J. Heinz.[95] In all, Pennsylvania is home to fifty Fortune
500 companies.[95] Erie is also home to GE Transportation Systems, which is
the largest producer of train locomotives in the United States.

As in the US as a whole and in most states, the largest private employer in
the Commonwealth is Wal-Mart, followed by the University of
Pennsylvania.[97][98] Pennsylvania is also home to the oldest investor-owned
utility company in the U.S.A, The York Water Company.

As of June 2014, the state's unemployment rate is 5.6%.[99]

### Banking[edit]

The first nationally chartered bank in the United States, the Bank of North
America, was founded in 1781 in Philadelphia. After a series of mergers, the
Bank of North America is part of Wells Fargo, which uses national charter 1.

Pennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank under the
1863 National Banking Act. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings & Trust Company
received a national charter and renamed itself the First National Bank of
Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank is still in
existence today as PNC Financial Services and remains based in Pittsburgh. PNC
is the state's largest bank, and the sixth-largest in the United States.

### Agriculture[edit]

Main article: Agriculture in Pennsylvania

**Pennsylvania ranks 19th overall in agricultural production**.[100]

  * The 1st is mushroom production,
  * The 2nd is apples,
  * The 3rd is Christmas trees and layer chickens,
  * The 4th is nursery and sod, milk, corn for silage, grapes grown (including juice grapes), and horses production.

It also ranks 8th in the nation in Winemaking.[101]

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture worked with private companies to
establish "PA Preferred" as a way to brand agricultural products grown or made
in the state to support and promote Pennsylvania products and locally-grown
food.[102]

The financial impact of agriculture in Pennsylvania[103] includes employment
of more than 66,800 people employed by the food manufacturing industry; and
over $1.7 billion in food product export (in 2011).

### Gambling[edit]

Main article: Gambling in Pennsylvania

Casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are
nine casinos across the state with three under construction or in planning.
Only horse racing, slot machines and electronic table games were legal in
Pennsylvania, although a bill to legalize table games was being negotiated in
the fall of 2009.[104] Table games such as poker, roulette, blackjack and
craps were finally approved by the state legislature in January 2010, being
signed into law by the Governor on January 7. Sports betting is illegal.

Former Governor Ed Rendell had considered legalizing video poker machines in
bars and private clubs in 2009, since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally
across the state.[105] Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor
license would be allowed up to 5 machines. All machines would be connected to
the state's computer system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a
50% tax on net gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with
the remaining 50% going to the establishment owners.

### Film[edit]

The Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit began in 2004 and stimulated the
development of a film industry in the state.[106]

### Government[edit]

Main article: Government of Pennsylvania

See also: Commonwealth (U.S. state)

Pennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood:[109] 1776, 1790,
1838, 1874, and 1968. Before that the province of Pennsylvania was governed
for a century by a Frame of Government, of which there were four versions:
1682, 1683, 1696, and 1701.[109] The capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg.
The legislature meets in the State Capitol there.

Further information: Political party strength in Pennsylvania

For most of the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st century,
Pennsylvania has been a powerful swing state. It only supported the losing
candidate in a presidential election twice from 1932 to 1988. Since 1992,
Pennsylvania has been trending Democratic in Presidential elections, voting
for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and slightly closer in 2000 for Al
Gore. In the 2004 Presidential Election, Senator John F. Kerry beat President
George W. Bush in Pennsylvania 2,938,095 (50.92%) to 2,793,847 (48.42%). In
the 2008 Presidential Election, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John
McCain in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 (54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). Most recently, in
the 2016 Presidential Election, Donald Trump became the first Republican
candidate to win the state since 1988, winning the state 48.6% to 47.8%.[110]
The state holds 20 electoral votes.[70]

In recent national elections, Pennsylvania has leaned Democratic. The state
voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992
and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign a recruitment drive saw registered
Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However,
Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011,
the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since
1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority
of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state
legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's
mansion 4 years later in the 2014 election. It was the first time since a
governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had
been defeated for reelection.

Historically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the
southeast, the Pittsburgh and Johnstown areas in the southwest, and Scranton
/Wilkes-Barre in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the
Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central,
northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among
the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the
Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there
was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a
Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the
millennium.

Democratic political consultant James Carville once pejoratively described
Pennsylvania as "Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama
in the middle". Political analysts and editorials refer to central
Pennsylvania as the "T" in statewide elections. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the
majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As
a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a
"T" shape.

#### Governor[edit]

Main article: List of Governors of Pennsylvania

The current Governor is Tom Wolf. The other elected officials composing the
executive branch are the Lieutenant Governor Michael Stack, Attorney General
Joshua Shapiro, Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, and Pennsylvania Treasurer
Joe Torsella. Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a ticket in the general
election and are up for reelection in 2018. Pennsylvania will hold elections
for Attorney General, Auditor General and Treasurer in 2016.[111]

See also: List of Pennsylvania state agencies

#### General Assembly[edit]

Main article: Pennsylvania General Assembly

Pennsylvania has a bicameral legislature set up by Commonwealth's constitution
in 1790. The original Frame of Government of William Penn had a unicameral
legislature.[112] The General Assembly includes 50 Senators[113] and 203
Representatives.[114] Joe Scarnati is currently President Pro Tempore of the
State Senate,[115] Dominic Pileggi the Majority Leader,[116] and Jay Costa the
Minority Leader.[117] Sam Smith is Speaker of the House of
Representatives,[118] with Mike Turzai as Majority Leader[119] and Frank
Dermody as Minority Leader.[120] As of the 2012 elections, the Republicans
hold the majority in the State House and Senate.

#### Judiciary[edit]

Main article: Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts,[121] most of which (except
Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly called district
justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly over preliminary
hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor (summary) criminal
offenses, and small civil claims.[121] Most criminal and civil cases originate
in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve as appellate courts to the
district judges and for local agency decisions.[121] The Superior Court hears
all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not expressly designated to the
Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also has original jurisdiction to
review warrants for wiretap surveillance.[121] The Commonwealth Court is
limited to appeals from final orders of certain state agencies and certain
designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas.[121] The Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania is the final appellate court. All judges in Pennsylvania are
elected; the chief justice is determined by seniority.[121]

#### Taxation[edit]

Pennsylvania has the 10th-highest tax burden in the United States.[122]
Residents pay a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per
capita average of $6,640 annually. Residents share 76% of the total tax
burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of taxes paid
by out of state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing natural gas
drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax on gas
drilling.[123] Additional revenue prospects include trying to place tolls on
interstate highways; specifically Interstate 80 which is used heavily by out
of state commuters with high maintenance costs.[124]

Sales tax provides 39% of Commonwealth's revenue; personal income tax 34%;
motor vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol beverage
5%.[125] Personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income
is based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary);
interest; dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession
or farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains or
income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived through
estates or trusts; and gambling and lottery winnings (other than Pennsylvania
Lottery winnings).[126]

Counties, municipalities, and school districts levy taxes on real estate. In
addition, some local bodies assess a wage tax on personal income. Generally,
the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with
home rule charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's
sixty-seven counties levy a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and
similar holdings.

With the exception of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania municipalities
and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the
purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are
required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state
returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a
private collection agency (e.g. Berkheimer, Keystone Collections, and Jordan
Tax Service) appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned
income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried
employees working within a particular municipality or school
district).[127][128][129][130]

The City of Philadelphia has its own local income taxation system.
Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage
tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working
for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their
Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer
does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to
register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return.
Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a
Net Profits tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from
Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License
(CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts tax (BIRT) and the NPT.
Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings
accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income tax (SIT).[131]

The complexity of Pennsylvania local tax filing system has been criticized by
experts, who note that the outsourcing collections to private entities is akin
to tax farming and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up
facing "failure to file" penalties even if they did not have any tax due.
Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level (i.e. by
having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the
method used to collect local income taxes in New York, Maryland, Indiana, and
Iowa) have been unsuccessful.[132]

### Federal Representation[edit]

Pennsylvania's two U.S. Senators are Bob Casey, Jr. and Pat Toomey.

Pennsylvania's current U.S. Representatives are Bob Brady (1st), Dwight Evans
(2nd), Mike Kelly (3rd), Scott Perry (4th), Glenn "G.T." Thompson (5th), Ryan
Costello (6th), Pat Meehan (7th), Brian Fitzpatrick (8th), Bill Shuster (9th),
Tom Marino (10th), Lou Barletta (11th), Keith Rothfus (12th), Brendan Boyle
(13th), Mike Doyle (14th), Charlie Dent (15th), Lloyd Smucker (16th), Matt
Cartwright (17th), Tim Murphy (18th).[133]

Allentown, Pennsylvania, 2010

Pennsylvania is divided into 67 counties.[134] Counties are further subdivided
into municipalities that are either incorporated as cities, boroughs, or
townships.[135] One county, Philadelphia County, is coterminous with the city
of Philadelphia after it was consolidated in 1854. The most populous county in
Pennsylvania is Philadelphia, while the least populous is Cameron (5,085).[66]

There are a total of 56 cities in Pennsylvania, which are classified, by
population, as either first-, second-, or third-class cities.[134][136]
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city, has a population of 1,526,006 and
is the state's only first-class city.[135] Pittsburgh (305,704) and Scranton
(76,089) are second-class and second-class 'A' cities, respectively.[135]

The rest of the cities, like the third and fourth-largest—Allentown (118,032)
and Erie (101,786)—to the smallest—Parker with a population of only 840—are
third-class cities.[137] First- and second-class cities are governed by a
"strong mayor" form of mayor–council government, whereas third-class cities
are governed by either a "weak mayor" form of government or a council–manager
government.[135]

Boroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most Pennsylvania cities
having been incorporated as a borough before being incorporated as a
city.[135] There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which governed by
the "weak mayor" form of mayor–council government.[134][135] The largest
borough in Pennsylvania is State College (42,034) and the smallest is
Centralia (10).

Townships are the third type of municipality in Pennsylvania and are
classified as either first-class or second-class townships. There are 1,454
second-class townships and 93 first-class townships.[138] Second-class
township can become first-class townships if it has a population density
greater than 300 inhabitants per square mile (120/km2) and a referendum is
passed supporting the change.[138] Pennsylvania's largest township is Upper
Darby Township (82,795), and the smallest is East Keating Township (11).

There is one exception to the types of municipalities in Pennsylvania:
Bloomsburg was incorporated as a town in 1870 and is, officially, the only
town in the state.[139] In 1975, McCandless Township adopted a home-rule
charter under the name of "Town of McCandless", but is, legally, still a
first-class township.[140]

The total of 56 cities, 958 boroughs, 93 first-class townships, 1,454 second-
class townships, and one town (Bloomsburg) is 2,562 municipalities.

The University of Pennsylvania quadrangle in Philadelphia

Pennsylvania has 500 public school districts, thousands of private schools,
publicly funded colleges and universities, and over 100 private institutions
of higher education.

### Primary and secondary education[edit]

In general, under state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory
for a child from the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an
accredited high school, whichever is earlier.[143] As of 2005, 83.8% of
Pennsylvania residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among
residents age 25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school.

The following are the four-year graduation rates for students completing high
school in 2015:[144]

Cohort | All Students | Male | Female | White | Hispanic | Black | Asian |
Special Education  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
 % graduating | 84.8 | 82.2 | 87.3 | 89.3 | 69.5 | 71.8 | 90.7 | 71.5  
  
Additionally, 25.7% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.[145]
State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007,
Pennsylvania ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing
for 8th grade students.[146]

In 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 169, which allows
parents or guardians to homeschool their children as an option for compulsory
school attendance. This law specifies the requirements and responsibilities of
the parents and the school district where the family lives.[147]

### Higher education[edit]

The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the public
university system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned schools. The
Commonwealth System of Higher Education is an organizing body of the 4 state-
related schools in Pennsylvania, these schools are independent institutions
that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly funded two-year
community colleges and technical schools that are separate from the PASSHE
system. Additionally there are many private two- and four-year technical
schools, colleges and universities.

Carnegie Mellon University, The Pennsylvania State University, the University
of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh, are members of the
Association of American Universities, an invitation only organization of
leading research universities. Lehigh University is also another renowned
private research university located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.The
Pennsylvania State University is the Commonwealth's Land-grant university, Sea
Grant College and, Space Grant College. The University of Pennsylvania,
located in Philadelphia, is considered the first university in the United
States and established the country's first medical school. The University of
Pennsylvania is also the Commonwealth's only, and geographically the most
southern, Ivy League school. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is the
first and oldest art school in the United States.[148] Philadelphia College of
Pharmacy, now a part of University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, was the
first pharmacy school in the United States.[149]

black bear, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and grouse are common game
species. Pennsylvania is considered one of the finest wild turkey hunting
states in the Union, alongside Texas and Alabama. Sport hunting in
Pennsylvania provides a massive boost for the Commonwealth's economy. A report
from The Center for Rural Pennsylvania (a Legislative Agency of the
Pennsylvania General Assembly) reported that hunting, fishing, and furtaking
generated a total of $9.6 billion statewide.

The Boone and Crockett Club shows that five of the ten largest (skull size)
black bear entries came from the state.[152] The state also has a tied record
for the largest hunter shot black bear in the Boone & Crockett books at 733 lb
(332 kg) and a skull of 23 3/16 tied with a bear shot in California in
1993.[152] The largest bear ever found dead was in Utah in 1975, and the
second-largest was shot by a poacher in the state in 1987.[152] Pennsylvania
holds the second-highest number of Boone & Crockett-recorded record black
bears at 183, second only to Wisconsin's 299.[152]

The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is the longest of the five tunnels on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, abbreviated as PennDOT, owns
39,861 miles (64,150 km) of the 121,770 miles (195,970 km) of roadway in the
state, making it the fifth-largest state highway system in the United
States.[153] The Pennsylvania Turnpike system is 535 miles (861 km) long, with
the mainline portion stretching from Ohio to Philadelphia and New Jersey.[153]
It is overseen by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Another major
east–west route is Interstate 80, which runs primarily in the northern tier of
the state from Ohio to New Jersey at the Delaware Water Gap. Interstate 90
travels the relatively short distance between Ohio and New York through Erie
County, in the extreme northwestern part of the state.

U.S. Route 220 as it passes through Lamar Township.

Primary north–south highways are Interstate 79 from its terminus in Erie
through Pittsburgh to West Virginia, Interstate 81 from New York through
Scranton, Lackawanna County and Harrisburg to Maryland and Interstate 476,
which begins 7 miles (11 km) north of the Delaware border, in Chester,
Delaware County and travels 132 miles (212 km) to Clarks Summit, Lackawanna
County, where it joins I-81. All but 20 miles (32 km) of I-476 is the
Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while the highway south of
the main line of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is officially called the "Veterans
Memorial Highway", but is commonly referred to by locals as the "Blue Route".

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is the sixth-
largest transit agency in the United States and operates the commuter, heavy
and light rail transit, and transit bus service in the Philadelphia
metropolitan area. The Port Authority of Allegheny County is the 25th-largest
transit agency and provides transit bus and light rail service in and around
Pittsburgh.[154]

Intercity passenger rail transit is provided by Amtrak, with the majority of
traffic occurring on the _Keystone Service_ in the high-speed Keystone
Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station before
heading north to New York City, as well as the _Northeast Regional_ providing
frequent high speed service up and down the Northeast Corridor. the
_Pennsylvanian_ follows the same route from New York City to Harrisburg, but
extends out to Pittsburgh. The _Capitol Limited_ also passes through
Pittsburgh, as well as Connellsville, on its way from Chicago to Washington,
D.C.[155] Traveling between Chicago and New York City, the _Lake Shore
Limited_ passes through Erie once in each direction.[155] There are 67  short-
line, freight railroads operating in Pennsylvania, the highest number in any
U.S. state.[155]

Pennsylvania has seven major airports: Philadelphia International, Pittsburgh
International, Lehigh Valley International, Harrisburg International, Erie
International, University Park Airport and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
International. A total of 134 public-use airports are located in the
state.[155] The port of Pittsburgh is the second-largest inland port in the
United States and the 18th-largest port overall; the Port of Philadelphia is
the 24th-largest port in the United States.[156] Pennsylvania's only port on
the Great Lakes is located in Erie.

The Allegheny River Lock and Dam Two is the most-used lock operated by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers of its 255 nationwide.[157] The dam

La Salle University (1954), Temple University (1938), University of
Pennsylvania (1920 and 1921), University of Pittsburgh (1928 and 1930), and
Villanova University (1985 and 2016).[162][163]

### Food[edit]

Hershey Chocolate Factory

Author Sharon Hernes Silverman calls Pennsylvania the snack food capital of
the world.[164] It leads all other states in the manufacture of pretzels and
potato chips. The Sturgis Pretzel House introduced the pretzel to America, and
companies like Anderson Bakery Company, Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and
Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Two of the
three companies that define the U.S. potato chip industry are based in
Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started making chips in Hanover,
Pennsylvania in 1921, and Wise Foods which started making chips in Berwick in
1921 (the third, Lay's Potato Chips, is a Texas company). Other companies such
as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, Snyder's of Berlin (not associated
with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer Farms Potato Products are popular chip
manufacturers.

The U.S. chocolate industry is centered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with Mars,
Godiva, and Wilbur Chocolate Company nearby, and smaller manufacturers such as
Asher's[165] in Souderton,[166] and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates of Dunmore. Other
notable companies include Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, makers of Hot
Tamales, Mike and Ikes, the Easter favorite marshmallow Peeps, and Boyer
Brothers of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is well known for its Mallo Cups.
Auntie Anne's Pretzels began as a market-stand in Downingtown, Pennsylvania,
and now has corporate headquarters in Lancaster City.[167] Traditional
Pennsylvania Dutch foods include chicken potpie, ham potpie, schnitz un knepp
(dried apples, ham, and dumplings), fasnachts (raised doughnuts), scrapple,
pretzels, bologna, chow-chow, and Shoofly pie. Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe,
Inc., headquartered in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, specializes in potato
bread, another traditional Pennsylvania Dutch food. D.G. Yuengling & Son,
America's oldest brewery, has been brewing beer in Pottsville since 1829.

Among the regional foods associated with Philadelphia are cheesesteaks,
hoagie, soft pretzels, Italian water ice, Irish potato candy, scrapple,
Tastykake, Wawa, and strombolis. In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by
Henry John Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser
extent than Heinz ketchup are the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant
sandwiches, pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge
there are dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by
thick, light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique
foods, including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and
mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania.

### Nicknames[edit]

Pennsylvania has been known as the _Keystone_ _State_ since 1802,[171] based
in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming
the United States, and also in part because of the number of important
American documents signed in the state (such as the Declaration of
Independence). It was also a keystone state economically, having both the
industry common to the North (making such wares as Conestoga wagons and
rifles)[172][173] and the agriculture common to the South (producing feed,
fiber, food, and tobacco).[174]

Another one of Pennsylvania's nicknames is the _Quaker_ _State_ ; in colonial
times, it was known officially as the _Quaker Province_ ,[175] in recognition
of Quaker[176] William Penn's _First Frame of Government_[177] constitution
for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience. He knew of the
hostility[178] Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual, taking oaths,
violence, war and military service, and what they viewed as ostentatious
frippery.[179]

" **The Coal State** ", " **The Oil State** ", " **The Chocolate State** ",
and " **The Steel State** " were adopted when those were the state's greatest
industries.[180]

"The State of Independence" currently appears on many road signs entering the
state.
