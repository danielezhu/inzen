International Times (it or IT) is the name of various underground newspapers, with the original title founded in London in 1966. Editors included Hoppy, David Mairowitz, Peter Stansill, Barry Miles, Jim Haynes and playwright Tom McGrath. Jack Moore, avant-garde writer William Levy and Mick Farren, singer of The Deviants, also edited at various periods. The IT restarted as an online archive in 2008. In 2011 it relaunched as on online magazine publishing new material. Irish poet Niall McDevitt was the first online editor of IT, a position now held by the poet and actor Heathcote Williams (editor-in-chief). The current editorial team includes Mike Lesser (1943 - 2015), Heathcote Williams, Elena Caldera, Claire Palmer, Nick Victor, David Erdos, Rupert Loydell and others.
The paper's logo is a black-and-white image of Theda Bara, vampish star of silent films. The founders' intention had been to use an image of actress Clara Bow, 1920s It girl, but a picture of Theda Bara was used by accident and, once deployed, not changed. Paul McCartney donated to the paper  as did Allen Ginsberg through his Committee on Poetry foundation.
