The Unisphere, with a diameter of 120 ft (37 m), is a spherical stainless steel representation of the Earth, located in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park (fourth-largest park in NYC, an area of 1255 acres) in the borough of Queens, New York City. There were two World's Fairs at the site (1939–40, 1964– 65), both largely the inspiration of Robert Moses. Because of the fairs, there were additions of new landscape and one of them is the Unisphere. The Unisphere is one of the borough's most iconic and enduring symbols.
Commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the space age, the Unisphere was conceived and constructed as the theme symbol of the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair. The theme of the World's Fair was "Peace Through Understanding" and the Unisphere represented the theme of global interdependence. It was dedicated to "Man's Achievements on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe".
