A pledge drive is an extended period of fundraising activities, generally used by public broadcasting stations to increase contributions. The term "pledge" originates from the promise that a contributor makes to send in funding at regular intervals for a certain amount of time. During a pledge drive, regular and special programming is followed by on-air appeals for pledges by station employees, who ask the audience to make their contributions, usually by phone or the Internet, during this break
Pledge drives are typically held two to four times annually, at calendar periods that vary (though, they are usually scheduled during the spring, summer and/or fall months) depending on the scheduling designated by the local public broadcasting station.
