Library Genesis or LibGen is a search engine for articles and books on various topics, which allows free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere at all. Among others it carries PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal.
In 2015, the website became involved in a legal case when Elsevier accused it of providing pirate access to articles and books. LibGen is reported to be registered in both Russia and Amsterdam, making it unclear which legislation applies, and whether defendants will show up in a United States court hearing. LibGen is blocked by a number of ISPs in the United Kingdom, but such DNS-based blocks are claimed to do little to deter access. In late October 2015, a New York district court ordered LibGen to shut down and to suspend use of the domain name (libgen.org), but the site is accessible through alternate domains.
As of July 2016, the database contains more than 52 million articles from about 50,000 publications.
