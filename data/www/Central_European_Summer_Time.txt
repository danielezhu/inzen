Central European Summer Time (CEST) is the standard clock time observed during the period of summer daylight-saving in those European countries which observe Central European Time (UTC+1) during the rest of the year. It corresponds to UTC+2, which makes it the same as Central Africa Time, South African Standard Time and Kaliningrad Time in Russia.
