A magnetic cartridge is a type of transducer used in the playback of analog sound recordings called records on a record player, now commonly called a turntable because of its most prominent component but formally known as a phonograph in the US and a gramophone in the UK.
Phono cartridges, also known as pickups, are electromechanical devices which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the record's groove. In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.
