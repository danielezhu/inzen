Miles Davis Volume 1 refers to two separate but related entities. The title was originally used for the first in a pair of compilation albums of recordings made by Miles Davis in 1952, 1953 and 1954, released in 1956 (and reissued many times) as BLP 1501 on the Blue Note Records label.
Miles Davis Volume 1 also refers to a CD compilation that contains the entirety of Young Man with a Horn (BLP 5013, 1951) plus three alternate takes, plus the entirety of Miles Davis, Vol. 3 (BLP 5040, 1954), both released on 10-inch LP.
The album was identified by Scott Yanow in his Allmusic essay "Hard Bop" in 2010 as one of the 17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings.
