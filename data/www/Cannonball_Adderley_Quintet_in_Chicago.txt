Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago (later released as Cannonball & Coltrane in 1964, on Limelight) is an album by jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, his final release on the Mercury label, featuring performances by Adderley with John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb.
With Bill Evans substituting for Wynton Kelly on most tracks, these musicians would record the classic album Kind of Blue (1959), with regular employer Miles Davis, shortly after this session.
