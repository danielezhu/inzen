Future Music Festival was an annual music festival featuring Australian and international artists held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth in Australia and as of 2012 also Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The festival is normally held in late February - early March and has been headlined by notable acts including The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, New Order, The Stone Roses and most recently Drake.
Several weeks after the 2015 edition of the festival, Mushroom Group announced their decision to scrap any future editions of the festival, however they offered hope for a new festival to take its place.
