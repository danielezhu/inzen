Jazzwise, launched in 1997, is the UKâ€™s biggest selling jazz monthly magazine and aims to be the leading English language jazz magazine in Europe. Jazzwise has a broad coverage, from the cutting edge of jazz, improv, hard bop, and jazz-rock to bebop and classic jazz, and also covers jazz crossover, including jazz-funk, jazz hip-hop and jazz-electronica. It features news coverage, a national gig guide, gossip column, a jazz-on-film page, opinion column, in-depth features and a review section covering new CD releases, reissues, vinyl, DVDs, books and live reviews. Breaking news stories also feature on the Jazzwise magazine website. Jazzwise also mentors new jazz writers through its ongoing intern scheme and the Write Stuff workshops held each November during the London Jazz Festival.
The Jazzwise app features the full edition of the magazine and was the first jazz magazine app in the iTunes Newsstand.
